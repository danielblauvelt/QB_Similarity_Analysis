Year,Name,Overview,Strengths,Weaknesses,Label
2025,Cam Ward,"Gunslinger with good size, a big arm and the mobility to help out his offensive line. Ward can read the full field and operates with average decision-making and processing quickness. Like a shortstop, he rips sidearm rockets that fit into tight windows on all three levels, but his delivery and mechanics cause inconsistencies with placement and accuracy. He is fairly consistent regardless of the coverage scheme he sees, but figuring out disguised coverage on the pro level will take time, and it is not a given he will develop that skill. He looks to strike it rich with aggressive, vertical throws; for better efficiency, he needs to learn to mine for gold with combo reads and rhythm throws. While he has the ability to move the sticks with his legs, he’s more of a pocket passer than a dual-threat quarterback. Pocket mobility helps him extend and make plays out of structure, but the longer he’s off-schedule, the spottier his decision-making can get. With a patient plan and a nurturing offensive coordinator who can accentuate his physical tools while regulating the feast-or-famine elements of his play, Ward could become a good NFL starter inside of his first contract.",Recognizes pre-snap pressure and can protect himself. Displays recognition for attacking holes in the coverage. Sudden release helps him thrive with quick game and seam throws. Can whip throws into tight windows from 25 yards away. Release quickness and velocity limit defender’s reaction time to the throw. Arm talent to make throws that others in this draft class cannot. Alters trajectory and touch for bucket throws. Mobility creates longer cover times and second-action opportunities. Able to read the front side and get to the back side with his progression. Bobs and weaves around the pocket and away from pressure points. Capable runner when the pocket breaks down but doesn’t bolt unnecessarily.,"Too willing to work out of structure and play hero ball. Struggled with Georgia Tech’s disguised coverages. Needs eye discipline to prevent coverage overlaps against zone. Inconsistent tying his feet with his eyes when scanning. Gets excited and cuts it loose before the route develops. Drop-down, sidearm release creates erratic placement. Seam throws become a security blanket when he’s uncomfortable. Unjustifiable interceptions from reckless cross-field throws. NFL QB-hunters will make him pay for reckless backward scrambles. Rears back and rips throws when touch and finesse is needed. Completed just 39% of his passes inside the red zone in 2024, per Pro Football Focus.",
2025,Shedeur Sanders,"Any perceptions that Sanders is a product of Heisman Trophy-winner Travis Hunter’s greatness are slowly dispelled once you hit the tape. He’s seen mixed results under an intensely bright spotlight, but there are no signs his confidence has ever wavered. Sanders possesses a baseline of poise, savvy and accuracy, traits that are integral in becoming an NFL starter. He’s slow-twitch with standard arm talent and a longer release, but he worked around those limitations with anticipation and accuracy. He plays with decent command from the pocket and finds his rhythm when working on-time and on-platform; that said, he will pass on profits and look for the big play too often. Average velocity and slower rip times mean tighter windows against faster athletes, so throwing off-platform or trying to do more than his arm talent allows is ill-advised. He’s tough and willing to take the hit to complete the throw once he’s locked into his target. Sanders is pocket mobile and finds clean alternate launch points, but he often creates pressure and sacks with undisciplined pocket drops. The tape says he has the necessary qualities to become a solid game manager if he can operate with better discipline and play to his strengths.",Plays with confidence and composure from the pocket. Keeps his eyes downfield as the pocket compresses. Shows off ability to pump and reset when the play appears not to develop as he expected. Able to buy himself time and move his launch point when needed. Willing to stand in and take punishment when he gets locked in on the throw. Gets hips squared to the target on rollout throws. Steps into drive throws between the hashes and puts it on-frame. Allows routes to develop and throws with timing into zone windows. Hits receivers in stride and leads them into yards after the catch. Consistently accurate when he throws from a balanced platform.,Spacing and clearly defined route combinations make decision-making easier. Drops beyond proper pocket depth and into edge rusher’s path. Throws with a longer operation time. Has completions on tape that will be interceptions in the pros. Inconsistent bringing his lower half through his delivery. Needs to become OK with taking profits and moving on. Appears too confident in his off-platform game despite a lack of zip. Doesn’t offer up much escapability quickness from the pocket. Much too willing to take a big sack instead of throwing it away.,
2025,Jaxson Dart,"Three-year SEC starter who saw improvement in play and production season after season. Dart has a stocky build and average physical attributes but good makeup and intangibles. He’s fairly accurate and rarely overcomplicates things for himself. He won’t strike anyone as a running quarterback, but he can find tough yards on the ground. He can make full-field reads but looks more comfortable grazing from the trough of the simple. He will need to work with better anticipation and decisiveness to win in tight windows as a pro. Teams might see physical and play similarities between Dart and Brock Purdy but such a pathway for Dart likely requires a balanced, ball-control passing attack that allows him to manage the game instead of driving it.",Gets across the full field of progressions when he needs to. Pretty good situational decision-maker on third downs. Throws with adequate accuracy and drive velocity between the hashes. Recognizes potential trouble and gets away from it. Beats man coverage when making predetermined throws. Very accurate with his back-shoulder fades. Runs with early acceleration and vision in the open field. Uses altered snap counts to draw defense into committing pre-snap penalties.,Deep zone coverages slowed his momentum and consistency. Has room for improvement with anticipatory throws versus zone. Lazy footwork forces him into muscled throws at times. Displayed inconsistencies with decisiveness in his reads. Lacks delivery quickness to afford getting behind on progressions. Throws feel very labored when he’s forced to work off-platform. Deep throws lack energy and force receivers to break stride.,
2025,Jalen Milroe,"Milroe is an explosive athlete who is very capable outside the pocket, but he lacks accuracy, touch and decision-making when he’s inside the pocket. A lack of anticipation and timing leads to interceptions and contested throws to intermediate areas of the field. He has an NFL arm, but he might need to fine-tune his footwork and delivery to improve accuracy on all three levels. He can get through his reads when he’s confident and feels protected but becomes predictable and easier for defenses to manipulate when he’s rattled. He’s built like a Will linebacker, runs like a receiver and is a threat to hit the home run on called runs and scrambles. Milroe was a much better deep-ball passer in 2023, but his 2024 regression makes it harder to project success from the pocket at a high enough rate to become a capable NFL starter. A strong arm and elite speed will have teams intrigued, but if he doesn’t make it as a starter, it’s incumbent upon his team to find a way to get the ball in his hands with packaged plays.","Unflinching when he delivers throws in the face of imminent contact. Has NFL arm strength, delivering drive throws with velocity. Ball comes out in a split second if he needs it to. Accuracy improves when he minds his weight transfer. 2023 tape shows a more consistent deep-ball passer. Good things happen as a passer when rolling out to his right. Finished career with 33 rushing TDs, including 20 in 2024. Back-breaking scrambler when defense loses lane integrity.",Threw five touchdowns and 10 interceptions in 2024 SEC play. Hurried and lacking rhythm when working from the pocket. Processing and decision-making are troubling at times. Struggles to make anticipatory throws. Success rate plummets when forced to come off primary option. Fires hard-to-catch rockets at underneath targets. Sails deep-outs and forces crossing routes to break stride to catch it. Slow to feel mounting pressure and takes too many sacks. Inconsistent trajectory on intermediate and deep-touch throws.,
2025,Will Howard,"Howard brings outstanding size and toughness to the table. He showed good improvement over the last three seasons. He is more a vessel of the play-caller than a playmaking talent, though. He typically reads half the field and makes reasonable decisions with the football, using good mechanics and consistent accuracy. He doesn’t hold defenders at bay with his eyes and lacks the arm strength to beat tight man coverage on second- and third-level throws. He showed good poise in 2024 to beat the blitz through the air and has always been able to escape pressure by making plays with his legs. Howard is big, tough and accurate but benefited from superior talent at the skill positions at Ohio State. Unless he proves he can play chess against NFL defenses, he might not have enough in the tool box to become more than an average backup.","Outstanding size and toughness inside and outside the pocket. Elevated his consistency and performance in the postseason. Can work off-platform with relative ease and efficiency. Throws from a grounded base with good mechanics and repeatable delivery. Delivers the ball with consistent accuracy to the frame. Able to buy time for routes to develop when pressured. Has poise, accuracy and touch to beat a blitzing defense. Uses legs on zone-read and for short-yardage carries.",Very gradual in his setup and release on three-step drops and RPOs. Can be mechanical and predictable from the pocket. Will struggle to beat NFL corners when throwing outside the numbers or into tight windows. Not enough eye manipulation to keep defenders guessing. Content with half-field reads instead of getting through his progressions. Had some contested throws bailed out by receivers’ ball skills.,
2025,Kyle McCord,"Pocket passer with good size who played in a high-volume, pro-passing scheme that should give him a head start as a pro. McCord was too inconsistent at Ohio State, relative to the talent around him, but he proved to be confident and productive last season at Syracuse without that same level of supporting talent. His fundamentals are usually solid and he plays with adequate poise in the face of pressure. He has enough arm to make window throws and push the ball around the field. McCord seeks to attack coverages vertically instead of operating as a “Checkdown Charlie.” While he can hit chunk throws, his decision-making and ball placement aren’t always good fits for his gunslinger mentality. His mobility inside and outside the pocket is average. McCord has good size, adequate talent and commendable resilience. He could find a home as a backup quarterback with modest upside.",Allows routes to breathe and mature when necessary. Reads coverage and progressions high to low when possible. Good feel for buying time and beating the blitz. Pretty good poise to manage unblocked pressure closing in. Arm strength to deliver deep-outs to the field side. Throws a catchable deep fade with adequate placement.,Below-average twitch to get the ball out quickly when needed. Tight trunk makes it tough to square and deliver on rollouts. Slower operation time allows corners to pounce and close his windows. Throws back into the middle of the field (and traffic) when scrambling. Average feel for placing throws between leveled coverage. Inconsistent to lead moving targets with his ball placement. Too willing to throw at a covered target despite lurking coverage. Allows edge pressure to close and sack him without climbing.,
2025,Tyler Shough,"Pocket passer with a seven-year college career prompted by three consecutive years of injuries while at Texas Tech. Shough will turn 26 in September, was in the same recruiting class as Trevor Lawrence and backed up Justin Herbert at Oregon. He’s a talented passer with a live arm who is capable of making pro throws both intermediate and deep but battles inconsistency. He plays with good field vision, using his eyes to hold defenders and set up his throwing windows. Shough is confident and accurate when protected, but will flinch when pressure mounts, leading to spotty decision-making and big sacks. His size and passing talent will be enticing, but durability and mobility concerns are impediments he will need to overcome.",Displays good command and full-field passing talent when protected. Adequate timing getting through his progressions. Effective use of eyes to hold linebackers and safeties. Splashy arm talent throws are all over his tape. Can sit down and crank up drive throws when needed. Pushes deep ball with effortless release and flick of the wrist. More naturally accurate thrower than stats might indicate. Can come off his primary target suddenly after spotting danger.,"Sluggish operation time working quick-game throws. Lacks poise and mobility to overcome turbulent pockets. Occasional issues allowing routes to unwind and develop. Falls way off delivery when pressure is mounting in front of him. Gunslinger mentality brings occasional lapses in decision-making. Not enough “extend and win” when flushed from the pocket. Missed substantial time due to injury in 2021, 2022 and 2023.",
2025,Quinn Ewers,"Ewers' arm talent and game flashes are enticing, but he hasn’t learned to play the game with a high enough level of consistency. The tape of road wins over Alabama and Michigan over the last two seasons showed the clearest picture of Ewers’ ceiling. He spins it with a sudden release and good touch over the first two levels and makes it look easy when he finds a rhythm. He won a high percentage of his career starts but struggled to put points on the board in most big games in 2024. Ewers rarely operates as a smooth, full-field reader. He often predetermines his target and throws into coverage instead of taking what the defense is offering. A lack of escapability will require him to process quickly enough to stay ahead of NFL blitz packages. The raw talent and upside will be alluring for pro-style passing attacks, but it’s fair to wonder if he will ever be able to rise above the talent on his roster and the ability of his play-caller to create favorable terms.",Displays willingness to go out and compete through pain. Performances in road games at Alabama (2023) and Michigan (2024) stand out. Makes it look easy when he’s working in rhythm. Arm talent to make trick-shot throws from a variety of angles. Gets the ball out in a hurry with just the flick of his wrist. Showed good pocket mobility to slide and deliver in 2023. Has games where footwork is clean and delivery is sharp. Capable of making touch throws from off-platform. Throws with consistent accuracy on boot-action rollouts.,"Can be fooled from pre-snap to post-snap looks by defense. Needs better eye manipulation to hold safeties and linebackers. Gets stuck on first read, regardless of coverage. Stares at primary receivers and will throw them into collisions. Lazy footwork forces receivers to break stride to make the catch. Will throw late and put too much air under some downfield throws. Must improve his feel and response to edge pressure.",
2025,Dillon Gabriel,"Gabriel is an older and smaller QB prospect, but he offers a tremendous amount of game experience and productivity. He operates with poise and confidence from the pocket. His field vision is average, but he typically takes care of the football. He’s capable of playing within the confines of an offense and can create yards with his legs as needed. Gabriel’s accuracy and timing is accurate on shorter throws, but the placement becomes erratic when pushed outside of his comfortable range. He might require a ball-control passing game to help manage his lack of arm talent and keep him from throwing into closing windows. He’s an effective scrambler who is able to elude pressure and make plays outside of the pocket. Gabriel requires a very specific offensive fit, but he’s a gamer with enough good tape to have a chance to become a decent backup.","Consistent production throughout his career. Elite total touchdown numbers, with 189 scores over 64 games. Has developed a decent feel for where to go with the football. Trusts his protection and rarely appears jittery in the pocket. Throws with good touch and natural operation. Equally capable with arm or legs when he exits the pocket. Dual-threat potential becomes elevated on third downs or near the end zone.","Lacks prototypical size for the position. Passing scheme allows him to work into big, defined windows. Vast majority of 2024 targets were inside of 10 yards, including 25% behind the line, per PFF. Average quickness getting through full-field scans. Sits on intermediate targets too long with his eyes. Ball placement and accuracy isn’t as good as it looks on paper. Lacks arm strength to lead receivers on deep shots off play-action. Deep-out and deep-seam throws lose their energy.",
2025,Riley Leonard,"Leonard has adequate size and is an above-average competitor with good toughness. However, he fails to hit the mark as a pro-caliber passer. He’s a dual-threat quarterback who falls more firmly on the side of grit than gifted. He can make controlled throws inside his comfort level, but his accuracy and timing dip when he has to work beyond primary reads. He’s relatively careful with the football in the red area and in the face of pressure. He can move the sticks with his legs on called runs or when pressured. Leonard is average as a field-reader and doesn’t have enough arm to beat NFL defenders on seam throws or outside the numbers. He needs a solid running game and advantages at the skill positions to function on a pro level, but even then his play might be more dependent on his legs than his eyes and arm.",Adequate size with above-average poise and toughness. Took great care of the football in the red zone over the last two seasons. Identifies safety and proceeds accordingly in early stages. Slides and climbs the pocket to elude and deliver. Won’t make many costly mistakes when blitzed. Mobility to exit the pocket and hurt defenses with his legs. Gritty runner with good success rate on short-yardage carries.,"Needs more muscle mass to continue making plays on the run in the pros. Slow operation time from setup to delivery on RPOs and three-step drops. Not enough arm talent for impromptu, off-platform throws. Accuracy and ball placement are too dependent on throw type. Struggles beating coverage into windows beyond the first level. Disappointing conversion rate as a third-down passer. Deep throws come up short and force receivers to break stride.",
2024,Caleb Williams,"Williams’ play is highlighted by rare escapability paired with the talent to exploit defenses once the play breaks down. He’s not tall, but he is well-built, with an arm to challenge defenses across the field. He can be a high-impact playmaker on the go or an effective pocket passer when he allows himself to trust his eyes on second and third reads. He can improve his accuracy and placement on intermediate and deep throws, but he’s unlikely to be known for pinpoint accuracy. It is admirable that he looks to keep his eyes up and make throws outside the pocket, but he’ll make things easier on himself early in his pro career by becoming a more decisive scrambler to move the sticks and carry on to the next set of downs. Williams is tremendously talented but often bites off too much responsibility and plays off-schedule. He has a good chance to hit new heights with a surrounding cast he trusts, but greater self-discipline and a well-structured offense might be needed to help him become a quarterback who can elevate a franchise to championship contention.","Forced to keep his team in games with high-end production and did so. Better consistency projected with pro targets who separate. Rapid-fire transition from fake to throw on RPOs. Twitchy release helps generate heat on drive throws. Puts enough pace on the ball to challenge safeties to a variety of spots. Will reset his pocket to create better throwing angles. Much improved at getting air under deep throws in 2023. Touchdown-to-interception ratio of 46:1 in red zone since the start of 2022 season, per Pro Football Focus. Keeps his eyes and arm alive when leaving the pocket. Rare talent to feel pressure, escape and extend the play.",Averse to playing throw-and-catch football on schedule. Eyes can become sticky and sluggish working through progressions. Must learn to throw with better anticipation/timing on the NFL level. Hero-ball mentality creates indecisiveness and inconsistent decision-making. Disconcerting deep-ball accuracy in QB-friendly offense. Will throw on the move unnecessarily rather than platform up. Passes up easy scramble yardage for more challenging throws.,
2024,Jayden Daniels,"With five seasons of starting experience under his belt, Daniels possesses a rare blend of playmaking talent and command from the pocket. He’s tall but slender, so there will be concerns about durability, considering how often he ran in college. However, teams must also recognize that he has no issues sitting in the pocket and working through progressions as a platform thrower with good mechanics and footwork. Daniels possesses the football intelligence to get himself protected and take care of the football with quality decision-making. He’s an accurate passer over the first two levels and throws with anticipation to slice and dice zone coverages. He had noticeable issues putting deep throws on faster receivers in stride, though. He lacks ideal size and arm talent, but he’s much more capable as a runner and passer than most of the quarterbacks who have moved on to the next level lately. Daniels is positioned to become a very good NFL starter in a spread-based passing attack.",Game is marked by command of the field and football intelligence. Recognizes pre-snap pressure and has a plan to counter it. Gets everyone on the same page when setting up protection. Full-field reader with good rhythm through his progressions. Willing to plant his flag and attack defenses from the pocket. Maintains passing platform when sliding around the pocket. Has made footwork as a passer a priority during his career. Anticipatory thrower with accuracy and feel for attacking zone windows. Has the running talent to turn scrambles into back-breaking plays. Has the speed to keep defenses honest with zone-read concepts.,"Slender frame will lead to durability concerns. Lack of zip creates danger for him outside the numbers. Will drop his eyes in the pocket to scan for exits. Below-average push and placement on deep throws. Substantially more accurate on rollouts than as a scrambling passer. Has a tendency to fall off of fade throws, leaving them short.",
2024,Drake Maye,"Challenging evaluation with top-flight measurables and tools but inconsistencies that create a lower floor. Maye’s size and arm talent jump off the tape immediately. He can make every throw, but he will try to make throws that he shouldn’t have attempted. The gunslinger mentality creates a fearlessness that can turn into interceptions, but it will also allow him to win in tight windows and make splash throws that get crowds (and evaluators) on their feet. He leaves too many throws on the back shoulder or hip and needs to learn when to take some sauce off the throw to make it more catchable. There is an undeniable energy to Maye’s game that can create momentum or turn chaotic when plays come off-schedule for him. The combination of traits and tape make him a boom/bust prospect who might need patient management and coaching to help shepherd him toward his potential.",Two years of starting experience and still very moldable. Two-time team captain with prototypical size and frame. Ball comes off his hand with tight spiral and good velocity. Can expedite operation time and release when pressure closes in. Unquestionable arm talent to connect from challenging angles. Fearless passer with the guts and arm to whip the ball into tight windows. Quick pocket climber with discipline to continue searching for targets. Mobility to slide free of pocket traffic and toughness to go get needed yards. Showed flashes of the clutch gene during his career.,Struggles with the chess match against pressure looks. Inefficient throwing motion creates inconsistencies in accuracy. Receivers had to chase too many intermediate throws into the turf. Leaves the ball behind crossing routes and RPO targets. Can get uncomfortable when initial reads aren’t clear and clean. Sixteen career interceptions were mostly earned with poor decisions or throws.,
2024,Michael Penix Jr.,"Penix will be a 24-year-old rookie with a history of season-ending injuries at Indiana and impressive production while at Washington. The Huskies’ offensive design helped declutter coverages for Penix, allowing him to throw a higher number of intermediate and deep passes. He plays with smart pocket mobility and a willingness to get rid of the football, which makes it difficult to sack him. His delivery is bundled and his release point is very low, but his monster game against Texas showed flashes of impeccable touch. Penix has plenty of arm but needs to work with more consistent timing between the numbers to eliminate unnecessary contested throws. He’s a pocket passer who was ineffective in 2023 when defenses were able to crank up the heat and make him move his feet. Playing in a shotgun-based spread attack might give him his best chance to succeed, but he needs to prove he can thrive outside of the Washington offense and stay free from injury.","Possesses enormous hands to control the football. Sees pressure creeping up pre-snap and gets himself protected. Makes sudden transition from his drop to his release. Slides from pressure and resets to find his platform. Wrist flick sends it 50-plus yards without much effort. Has ability to make drive throws with added velocity when needed. Fearless attacking far-sideline buckets between corner and safety. Sacked just 31 times over 1,759 career dropbacks, per PFF.","Suffered multiple season-ending injuries during his time at Indiana, including tearing his right ACL twice. Posted 20 TDs and 9 INTs over his final 11 games of the 2023 season. Forces receivers to break stride on a variety of throws. Throws with wide-open front side when feet fail to follow his eyes. Heavily reliant upon receiving talent winning jump balls. Production/consistency plummet when forced to throw outside the pocket.",
2024,JJ McCarthy,"Enigmatic quarterback lacking the measurables and splash throws associated with early round quarterbacks but possessing elements that require more study and consideration. McCarthy lacks frame thickness and a plus arm. He’s fairly poised in the pocket but is average as a pocket passer. His ball placement and timing need to improve to help mitigate an average operation time due to a windup release. McCarthy doesn’t seek to play out of structure but is fairly consistent at making positive plays when it happens and ramps up his focus late in games and on third downs. He is confident and seems to have the ability to take slights and digest it as competitive fuel. McCarthy should continue to improve as a passer, but he fails to stand out in many of the areas that tend to be predictive of top-level success in the NFL.",Plays with a chip on his shoulder and intensifies focus when needed. Plenty of experience working under center in pro-style passing scheme. Won’t hesitate to slide and find new launch points when pressure builds. Adequate ability to locate throwing windows versus zone. Makes drive throws between defenders with good decisiveness. Delivers the ball smoothly on rollouts and in scramble mode. One of the draft’s most efficient quarterbacks operating out of structure. Toughness to deliver throws when taking a hit and squeeze out extra yards as runner.,"Sluggish getting through progressions and can get stuck on first read. Modest arm strength might be magnified by windup in his delivery. Ball placement on tape belies completion percentage on the stat sheet. Leaves throws behind moving targets, allowing defenders to challenge catches. Deep balls need to come out quicker and with more air under them. Timing improved during the season but still crowds receivers to coverage. Average escapability as a runner when scrambling.",
2024,Bo Nix,"Rare five-year starting quarterback whose play has matured in front of our eyes. Nix displays the accuracy, arm talent and athleticism consistent with today’s brand of pro quarterback. He can be punctual in getting the ball out at the top of his drop or he can work through progressions and beat defenses with second-reaction plays. He throws with good velocity and puts the ball on the money when throwing on the move. Nix has shown great improvement with his pocket poise. He’s capable of moving the sticks as a scrambler or as part of the running game. Some of his gaudy production has been driven by the Oregon offense’s design, but his talent clearly stands out. I’ve harbored bias from watching the overwhelmed version of Nix during his Auburn days, but as the saying goes, “tape don’t lie.” Nix appears more than ready to attack the league with an NFL-caliber skill set.","Good pre-snap recognition for expedited post-snap itinerary. Big hands to manipulate defenses with aggressive pump fakes. Shows ability to work through options and find what he likes. Generates quality velocity from a sudden, compact release. Ball comes out of his hand with good pace and without much effort. Impressive run-and-rip talent throwing accurately on the move. Play-extender with arm talent to win with secondary action as passer. Internal clock and athleticism help him avoid sacks. Toughness and talent to move the sticks on called runs.","Nearly 30 percent of his passes in 2023 were thrown behind the line of scrimmage, per Pro Football Focus. Tends to short-arm throws when blitz is leaking in. Decision-making can take a hit when he extends the play. Left easy touchdowns on the field due to overthrows. Bucket throws will come out a little flat. Needs to do a better job of throwing receivers away from coverage.",
2024,Spencer Rattler,"Four-year starter who took more starting snaps at South Carolina than he did at Oklahoma. Rattler will still flash glimpses of what he showed in his 2020 season as a Sooner but fails to consistently sustain the type of play that NFL teams look for. He lacks desired height for a pocket passer and doesn't have enough arm strength to beat greedy NFL cover men. He was better than some of his 2023 numbers might indicate, as poor pass-blocking and drop-prone receivers often put him in bad spots. He can scramble and extend plays, but he's not a dynamic runner and needs optimal protection and separation in order to work in rhythm. He needs an offense that can shrink the field so he can operate quickly and find his rhythm. He has the know-how but might not have the tape or traits to inspire confidence in projecting anything more than a QB2/3.",Feet follow his eyes; throws with accuracy when comfortable. Quick to snap into release motion when throwing on RPO looks. Takes time but is capable of getting through full-field reads. Patient to allow the routes and spacing to mature before throwing. Stands tough in the face of pressure and willing to take shots to complete throws. Helps his own cause by slipping past would-be sacks to extend the play. Not overly dynamic as a runner but can go and get first downs.,"Struggles to consistently process efficient reads and opportunities. Eyes float to and stay with primary receiver even against tight coverage. Lacks NFL drive velocity, and deep balls have no late life on them. Leaves too many in-breaking throws on receiver's back hip. Creates too much commotion for his receivers between the hashes. Muscle and accuracy on move throws are below average. Defaults into back-leg throws when pressure begins to mount.",
2024,Jordan Travis,"In a career marked with challenges, Travis showed the resilience to overcome and finish his career playing his best football. He’s undersized but has an adequate arm and can help protect himself with his legs. The footwork isn’t always great, but he can throw effectively and fairly accurately as an improviser. Travis doesn’t usually beat defenses with pre-snap planning or eye work and can be a step slow to get through progressions and throw with anticipation. He displays good leadership and desires to take care of the football. Travis’ traits don’t stand out, but his mobility and continued growth as a passer could give him a shot to compete for a spot as a QB2/3 if evaluations of his leg injury check out.",Possesses adequate arm strength to make NFL throws. Able to expedite his delivery for sudden throws when needed. Is generally accurate when throwing to intermediate targets. Improved at recognizing lurking defenders and avoiding the danger. Can find targets and put the ball on them when he’s on the move. Feels edge pressure and climbs pocket or exits the side door. Talented as a scrambler/runner and competes to move the chains.,"Season-ending leg injury could prevent pre-draft workouts. Plays with average pre-snap diagnosis on where opportunities should exist. Pace can be stale through progressions, causing him to miss open targets. Needs to become a more decisive passer on the next level. Occasional signs of panic that turn into poor decision-making with the ball. Aims it and pulls up short on his follow-through at times.",
2024,Joe Milton,"Rare physical specimen with the proverbial ""arm talent to make all the NFL throws,"" but he's prevented from doing so by a lack of timing, accuracy and touch. Milton is gifted with a cannon for a right arm and can throw the ball as hard or as far as you want. His fastballs are often inaccurate and difficult to catch for moving targets, and he was wildly inconsistent locating his deep throws. He can elude pressure, extend plays and put jaw-dropping highlights on tape, but he's never been able to mature his game from splashy to consistent. He's primarily a single-side reader who struggles to improvise with his eyes. The physical ingredients could get him drafted on Day 3, but his lack of development over six seasons discourages his projection.",Elite size and arm strength are both well beyond positional norms. Throws blazing heat to beat coverage into tight windows. Delivers long off-platform throws with the flick of the wrist. Will stand his ground and take punishing hits to make the throw. Able to keep eyes downfield while deftly sliding around pocket pressure. Posted 32 TDs against just five INTs over three seasons at Tennessee. Strong against potential sacks and escapes the pocket to extend the play.,"Disturbing lack of placement and timing as a deep-ball passer. Completed just 38.6 percent of his throws beyond 10 yards (per Pro Football Focus) in 2023. Struggles with anticipatory throws, running receivers into collisions. Telegraphs throws between the hashes, giving safeties an easy jump on the ball. Desires to throw the ball through receivers rather than deliver with touch. Inconsistent tying his feet to eyes and squaring to his targets. Frequently forces moving targets to break stride to try to make the catch.",
2023,Bryce Young,"Slightly built with measurables that fall below the standard for the quarterback position, Young’s talent and face-of-the-franchise potential could force teams to focus more on his game film and less on his size. Young has had the advantage of working with a former NFL head coach (Bill O’Brien) who understands the challenges facing a pro quarterback. He’s a full-field reader whose confident demeanor on the field oozes off the tape but never becomes unbridled cockiness. He’s thoughtful in where he wants to go with the football and keeps the turnover count low. The deep ball is nothing special and his drive velocity fails to stand out, but he has enough arm strength to make the necessary throws. Young is perfectly capable of extending plays both inside and outside the pocket, but teams will want him to stay on schedule a little more often as a pro passer. He’s poised in the face of both physical and situational pressure and possesses a full offering of intangibles that helps set him apart from some of the more physically gifted quarterbacks in this class.",Calm demeanor on the field. Played in a pro-style attack that required full-field reads. Shows ability to dial up focus in big fourth quarter situations. Uses eye manipulation to create easier throws. Locates and avoids lurking trouble in zone coverage. Good operation time with a compact release as thrower. Unfazed by incoming rush and makes ball delivery his priority. Good rush awareness and pocket mobility. Actively reroutes his receivers when play extends. Makes defenses pay when he breaks contain and improvises.,"Weighed in at 204 pounds at the NFL Scouting Combine; since 2003, no QB who weighed fewer than 207 pounds at the combine has been drafted in Round 1. Durability will be a concern due to slight frame. Has a tendency to run receivers up against the boundary. Leaves his lower half behind on drive throws at times. Needs to prove he can find reads quickly and stay on schedule. Deep throws come out flat and lose energy late. Doesn’t run as often as he could to counter the rush and pick up first downs.",
2023,CJ Stroud,"Two-year starter from a program with a high-octane offense known for creating high-level production opportunities for its quarterbacks. Stroud’s accuracy stands out on tape. He’s able to lead receivers with good placement and make on-frame throws to targets on all areas of the field. The question now is how quickly he will acclimate outside of the Ohio State scheme. Stroud didn’t often attack defenses with his legs, but if he can become a more willing runner, he will be able to extend drives rather than feeling forced into more challenging decision-making situations. NFL teams will have to balance what they saw on tape from Stroud during the 2022 regular season against his great College Football Playoff semifinal performance, when he shined versus Georgia’s impressive collection pro prospects. If he did it once he can do it again, and grading the flashes for Stroud might make the most sense.","Doesn’t hesitate to attack with his throws. Has the arm strength to air out the deep ball toward the sideline with accuracy. Played the game of his career against Georgia in College Football Playoff semifinal. Showed willingness to extend and make plays outside the pocket against Georgia. Finds his way back to platform throws when forced to move his feet. Tapes shows ability to get through progressions. Enough arm talent to pump, reset and then release. The most naturally accurate top-tier quarterback in the 2023 draft class. Puts it on frame, allowing receivers to catch in stride and keep rolling. Showed maturity as game manager at times during 2022 season.",Hesitance to use his legs can put a cap on his success rate. Labors to get squared to target when rolling out. Needs a clearer scan for potential pressure points near the line of scrimmage. Needs to play with better recognition and respect for safeties. Inconsistent activating lower-body torque on drive throws. Interceptions arise when he refuses to come off primary receiver.,
2023,Anthony Richardson,"Dual-threat quarterback with an elite physical profile and a lot of work that needs to be done to reach a potentially high ceiling. Richardson’s frame, arm talent and mobility will demand respect as a potential first-round option. He has the ability to make plays on the move that very few of his NFL peers will be able to make. However, but his accuracy on short and simple throws left much to be desired due, in part, to shoddy footwork and inconsistent rhythm. The footwork issues can be corrected, but the challenge will be determining whether he can be at least a functionally accurate passer at the next level. Richardson’s potential to strike with the deep ball, attack the secondary from sideline to sideline and gash teams with his legs creates greater leeway in his projection as a developmental prospect. Ultimately, he will succeed or fail based on his ability to play with better post-snap recognition and deliver the football with consistency.","Elite size, strength and athletic ability for the quarterback position. Has potential to perform in a variety of offensive schemes. Can make explosive plays as a passer and runner. Arm strength to throw downfield and into tight windows. Functional pass accuracy when mechanically sound and in rhythm. Willing to take a hit and still deliver the throw. Good awareness of pressure mounting around him. Footwork to slide and throw or scramble for yards. Had touchdown-to-interception ratio of 12:2 over his final six games at Florida. Ran for touchdowns of 45, 60, 73, 80 and 81 yards over the past two seasons.",Inconsistency and inaccuracy made it hard for him to have sustained success. Could use a better feel for the timing of his progressions. Needs to take some spice off short throws. Below average touch and ball placement rolling out. Hasn’t learned to manipulate coverage with his eyes. Struggles to paint intermediate zone holes with anticipatory throws. Accuracy issues are often a function of poor footwork. Loses track of coverage and will throw into danger. Too willing to flip the ball out instead of taking a sack.,
2023,Will Levis,"Levis is one of the most physically gifted quarterbacks in the draft, but there are warts in his game that might not be easily corrected. He has prototypical size and experience operating in a pro-style passing attack. He’s an athletic passer, with the ability to zip off-platform throws with plus velocity from a compact release. He struggled to put together an extended period of high-caliber quarterback play in 2022, but was also dealing with injuries that he fought his way through for much of the season. Levis has the arm to beat coverages on all three levels, but inadequate placement and accuracy have created a lot of uncatchable throws. He’s a capable runner outside the pocket but needs to improve his feel for pressure and his consistency when throwing on the move. Levis’ talent is well worth an investment, but could require a talented quarterback coach and a patient plan to tighten up his mechanics, rebuild his confidence and explore an offensive scheme that best suits him.","Prototypical size and build for an NFL quarterback. Has experience taking snaps from under center. Played in pro-style passing scheme requiring full field reads. Athletic passer when working off-platform. Release is compact, twitchy and effortless. Extremely tough and played through injuries in 2022. Serious arm talent with ability to complete passes in tight windows. Can send deep passes over the heads of tardy safeties. Ability to slide and throw simultaneously from the pocket. Willing and capable as a runner near the goal line.","Nearly a quarter of his passes were thrown to targets behind the line of scrimmage in 2022, per PFF. Inconsistent post-snap confidence to throw on time. Uncomfortable working against short zones. Big struggles finding his rhythm as a passer in 2022. Falls into off-platform throws rather than trusting the footwork. Scattershot ball placement and accuracy on simple throws. Poor feel inside the pocket for pressure points. Career TD-INT ratio falls below 2:1 mark. Poor second reaction decision-making with the football.",
2023,Hendon Hooker,"Hooker’s age and ACL tear will be starting points for many draft conversations, but the most important question to be answered is whether he can thrive outside of the Tennessee offense. Hooker was frequently a half-field reader, which means he could lean on spacing, speed and/or route combinations to make life easier. He’s more accurate outside the numbers than between the hashes and his deep ball placement was much more uneven than expected. However, Hooker plays with excellent poise and footwork as a pocket passer. He will make quarterback coaches and play-callers happy with his adherence to keeping plays on schedule. He’s still showing signs of improvement and growth at the position, and his ability to hurt teams with his legs creates opportunities to help his offense outside of what he does in the pocket. His recovery from the ACL tear will require monitoring, but he has the talent to become a starter in a timing-based, spread offense.","Blends NFL pocket-passer size with dual-threat athleticism. Rhythmic passer who prefers to keep plays on schedule. Good operation time with twitchy release in quick game. Patient in allowing route combinations to develop. Footwork is as dialed in and consistent as you’ll find among this year’s QB prospects. Avoids high risk, low yield throws for the most part. TD-INT ratio of 58:5 in the last two seasons. Sticks with delivery regardless of pressure. Feels edges collapsing and climbs pocket to safety. Helps identify protection for running backs. Above average acceleration for success on called runs or as a scrambler.","Sustained torn ACL in left knee late last season. Coming off injury as a 25-year-old rookie. Rarely required to get through a slate of progressions in the Vols’ offense. Might need to prove he can make window throws to stationary targets. Sailed too many of his throws between the hashes. Struggled when forced to throw on the move. Left touchdowns on the field due to inconsistent placement on deep throws. Internal clock hits snooze at times, leading to sacks that could have been avoided. Takes on too much contact as a runner.",
2023,Stetson Bennett,"Bennett will turn 26 years old during his rookie season and he’s small in stature relative to today’s game. Those two things will work against him, but his history of elevating his play in spotlight games against the best competition should be a factor for some teams. He doesn’t have a plus arm and his accuracy and placement can vary from drive to drive, but he throws with anticipation and has shown an ability to get through progressions as a pro-style passer. He’s rarely sacked and has the mobility to do damage outside of the pocket. Bennett has backup potential for a timing-based passing attack that includes concepts often seen in the Shanahan offense.","Confidence and focus appear to elevate in the biggest games. Posted 308.8 passing yards per game with a completion rate of 67.7 percent and TD-INT ratio of 19:3 while going 5-1 over last six postseason games. Able to scan progressions across the entire field. Moves his feet with his eyes for throw readiness. No trouble coming off of primary read if it isn’t there. Pump fakes to freeze cornerback on high/low concepts. Makes throws with excellent anticipation from the pocket. Sacked just 24 times over the past two seasons, per PFF. Athletic with very good speed once he becomes a runner.","Very small and slight for the position by NFL standards. Game to game consistency has been an issue at times. Needs to navigate the pocket for cleaner launch points. Lacks drive velocity to fit throws into a tight window. Will fall off of some throws unnecessarily. Release timing for play-action and rollouts is uneven. Runs targets into collisions on zone throws between hashes. Struggles with placement, touch and distance on many deep throws.",
2023,Aidan O'Connell,"O’Connell’s 2021 tape is better than what we saw from him in 2022, but there were still flashes last season. He’s a pocket passer who can throw with solid accuracy over the first two levels but struggles with trajectory and rhythm on deep targets. O’Connell has below-average mobility inside and outside the pocket. He needs to keep his progressions on schedule and his throws on time to make up for average arm strength. He had to carry a heavy percentage of the offense on his back at Purdue and could benefit from an offense that allows him to manage games. O’Connell has backup potential and his upside is slightly above average.",Experience playing under center and in a pro-style system. Stands tall in the pocket and delivers over the top. Play-action throws feature good timing to the route. Anticipatory passing makes up for a lack of velocity. Good accuracy and placement throwing between the hashes. Completion totals hurt by a high number of drops by receivers. Willing to check it down and move on to the next play. Makes attempts to get the ball out instead of taking a sack.,"Slow, plodding feet in his pocket setup. Staring at targets allows linebackers and safeties to get a jump on the throw. Can be a little too stubborn in sticking with his primary read. Rarely gets his back hip rotated through the delivery. Sensitivity to pressure causes rushed read and ball delivery. Average velocity leads to floating sideline throws. Completed just 29.6 percent of his deep throws in 2022. Leggy strides hinder ability to escape pocket peril.",
2023,Clayton Tune,"Resilient in the face of adversity, Tune has proven that he can come back from slow starts and finish seasons strong. He’s more of a snap-taker than playmaker. He’s a full-field reader who needs plays to stay on time, as he lacks improvisational talent. Without a plus physical or athletic profile to lean on, Tune must learn to speed up his eyes, quiet his feet and improve his post-snap process to beat NFL defenses with timing and accuracy.",Four-year starter and three-time team captain. Proven ability to overcome adversity. Works his feet to find platform deliveries when possible. Patience and willing to work through progressions. Uses rhythmic pocket climbs to secure his delivery. Adequate drive power between the hashes when planted. Maintains field scan when leaving the pocket.,"Footwork can be too undisciplined in the pocket. Pressure tends to rattle the reads. Might not trust his arm enough for fearless, tight-window throws. Lacks anticipation and zip for consistent ball placement. Release quickness can be sluggish. Throws receivers against the sideline too often. Accuracy plummets when forced to move his feet.",
2023,Dorian Thompson-Robinson,"Five-year starter with below-average size, above-average mobility and a recent history of improvement at the position. Thompson-Robinson played in a favorable scheme for quarterbacks, but he also improved as a field-reader over time. While he can extend plays and create opportunities for himself outside of the pocket, he’s at his best when he’s throwing on time and utilizing possession throws as his base. He has lapses in vision and judgment against zone and when pressured, so he must cut down on ill-advised throws. Thompson-Robinson has the potential to find a home as a QB3 with a QB2 ceiling.","Has shown improvement under head coach Chip Kelly. Gets through his progressions with good timing. Can layer throws between linebackers and safeties. Delivers football with a tight spiral. Enough arm to challenge the seam and Cover 2 buckets. Very accurate passer in quick game and on possession throws. Improvisational talent to make plays when pocket breaks down. Mobility creates additional stress on defenders. Shifty runner in the open field, with 28 career rushing touchdowns.","Needs to narrow base and shorten stride when working from the pocket. Loses track of lurking zone defenders, which leads to interceptions. Few anticipatory throws into zone holes between the hashes. Decision-making can be problematic when he’s not in rhythm. Delivery operation needs to become quicker. Throws with elongated wind-up, dropping the ball to his waist. Will occasionally throw off-platform unnecessarily. Below-average deep-ball passer, lacking touch and accuracy.",
2022,Kenny Pickett,"Pickett has five years of game experience and four years of starting experience for Pitt. He's a fairly toolsy pocket passer with good mobility. He operated in a passing scheme featuring vertical concepts that created big-play opportunities but left food on the plate when he failed to play chess against the back-end of the coverage. Pickett works with average anticipation but drives the ball with good velocity, which should help him shine in pre-draft passing drills. Pickett's touch and placement need work, but his accuracy stats were damaged by an inordinate amount of drops throughout his career. The top indicator for future success or failure will likely rest in a team's ability to build Pickett's trust, poise and discipline from the pocket. He can make all the throws, but he'll only be able to execute against disguised fronts and NFL pressure if he's willing to hang in and win with his eyes first. He carries a boom/bust label, but the 2021 tape and productivity showed off his potential to become a good starter in time.",Broke Dan Marino's Pitt passing records. Comes from athletic family and bloodlines. Has good size and all the physical tools needed as a pro. Jaw-dropping improvement across the board from 2020. TD-INT ratio went from 13:9 in 2020 to 42:7 in 2021. Passing scheme required full-field reads. Good recognition and decisions on combo-route throws to all levels. Potential to get better at recalibrating reads with more work. Worked with improved anticipation and tight spiral throwing into windows. Velocity to stay ahead of closing coverage. Arm strength to push deep outs without a problem. Able to extend the play and win on the move with his arm. Arm talent to make off-platform throws. Elusiveness to escape a free runner and scramble for yards.,Some scarring from previous protection issues. Nervous feet and poise can get the best of him despite clean pockets. Drifts outside pocket rather than climbing to scan. Feet don't always follow his eyes when throwing. Poor placement and touch added to drop issues. Finesse throws into buckets are below average. Better timing would prevent contested catches. Can improve at making leading throws. Doesn't throw with much of an expedited release. Needs to take the incompletion instead of the sack.,Backup
2022,Desmond Ridder,"Four-year starter and four-year winner whose hard work at his craft altered his standing from good college quarterback to early-round draft pick. There is nothing special about Ridder's size or arm talent but his improved confidence and field command has really helped him mature at the position. He plays in rhythm and operates with consistently repeatable footwork and mechanics. He's intelligent and processes quickly, which should help him find where the football needs to go regardless of passing scheme. Getting the ball to NFL targets accurately and safely, however, is not a given. Despite favorable mechanics, his accuracy and ball placement need work and he doesn't have the arm strength or release quickness to consistently survive off-target throws against pro coverage. He can run but is more of a pocket passer who can win with his legs than a true dual-threat quarterback.",Jump in production and play from 2020 to 2021. Team captain who plays with confidence and command on the field. Mobile and athletic but looks to win from the pocket. Pocket poise with easy slide away from pressure points. Quick to process what the defense shows him. Uses eyes to hold single-high safety and set up a deep shot. Patient in allowing routes to mature and uncover. Mobility to elude pressure and reset launch point outside the pocket. Machine-like mechanics and footwork. Operates from a well-balanced platform. Able to pump and alter target choice when needed. Changes speeds and alters touch underneath. Throws the out route with timing and break anticipation. Speed to turn a scramble into a chunk play.,"Deep balls have a tendency to come up short. Gives safeties time to range over the top from the post. Average arm strength for tight-window throws. Windup slows overall release quickness. Slower operation time led to 26 career batted passes, per PFF. Struggles in throwing receivers open. Inconsistent accuracy on intermediate throws. Rarely gets all the way through his progressions. Average elusiveness could bring heavy punishment as a runner. Below-average placement and velocity for pro throws. Peels back and over the top of the pocket, leading to sacks.",Backup
2022,Malik Willis,"Upside quarterback with special parts of his game, but with no guarantee they will be assembled properly into a finished product. Willis uses his rare combination of elite rushing talent and a rocket-launching right arm to unlock explosive plays in two different ways. He has the arm to beat safeties to the deepest parts of the field and makes impressive throws from inside and outside the pocket. On the flip side, Willis' mechanical and operational inconsistencies lead to erratic timing and accuracy, and he doesn't throw with enough touch. Protection and receiver separation were both issues, but Willis also pressed over the second half of the season and never looked comfortable in the Liberty offense. On the pro level, additional film work and a layered, pro-style passing attack could allow for more focused reads and help him see the field faster and more clearly from the pocket. Play-callers must lean into his special talent as a runner and include called runs into the game plan. Even if Willis fails to reach his passing potential, running ability doesn't slump and he has the talent to produce on the ground at a level between Jalen Hurts and Lamar Jackson.","Electrifying dual-threat ability and potential. Frame is compact, broad and powerful. Rare escapability and elusiveness on the go. Finishes strong and gets what is needed on called runs. Ran for 100-plus yards five times over the last two years. Able to pace his release according to need. Ability to recognize blitz and get the ball out. Makes drive throws with twitchy hips. Arm strength capable of winning in tight windows. Beats safeties on deep sideline throws. Ability to work through progressions when protected. Wide-lens field scan on rollouts and scrambles. Rapid mesh-point transition to throw on RPOs. Strong hands for fluid pump, reset and launch.","Set depth will get away from him at times. Below average climbing pocket and staying throw-ready. Drops eyes rather than standing in and delivering in the face of pressure. Too many missed opportunities to make easy, on-schedule throws. Allows throwing windows to close on him. Poor field recognition and progression quickness over second half of the season. Pressed and took unnecessary sacks. Throwing mechanics lack repeatable consistency. Needs to calm and settle his feet from the pocket. Elbow drop and overstride have been culprits. Deep balls can be rushed and a little flat. Lack of touch greatly diminishes his margin for error as a thrower. Ball placement causes stride breaks and adjustments for wideouts. Accuracy plummets when scrambling. Major struggles bringing in snaps and securing through contact in 2020",Backup
2022,Matt Corral,"Small quarterback with a big heart who has learned to play with better maturity and control without losing his edge. Corral played in a quarterback-friendly scheme with well-defined reads, so he needs to prove he can work through full-field progressions and make good decisions with the ball. He's decisive, operating with a quick-trigger release to challenge tight windows and possesses the touch to make challenging bucket throws. He's a fiercely competitive runner but needs to get his slide game up as he's not built to take the pounding from called runs or scrambles. Corral is mobile, but his poise and accuracy wane when forced to move. Discipline has benefitted Corral and he's clearly at his best when operating on-schedule and in rhythm. A spread-based scheme and a player-friendly head coach gives Corral the best opportunity to live up to his potential and challenge to become the best QB from this draft class.","Competes hard and plays with an abundance of confidence. Quicker processor and better decision-maker in 2021. Hasty ball-handling for quick game and RPOs. Impressive release quickness and rips a tight spiral. Touch and fearlessness to work between leveled coverage. Generally patient, allowing routes to develop. Above-average arm strength for smaller quarterback. Twitched-up hips to generate drive on window throws. Made 60-yard throw without having his feet set against Alabama. Throws fluffy, well-placed deep ball when protected. Would rather take sack then put the ball up for grabs. Would have had significantly higher completion rate if not for excessive drops. Able to slip away from pressure. Both elusive and combative on called runs and scrambles.",Slender frame with size falling below desired NFL mark. Too haphazard as a runner to sustain durability. Scouts question whether he has necessary maturity. Benefits from heavy play-action and RPO looks. Needs to prove he can become a full-field reader. Babies and aims the short throw. Deep ball needs to come out earlier for speedy NFL targets. Will take unnecessary chances against lingering safety help. Most of his interceptions were layups for the defender. Poise and placement take a hit once his feet are moving. Takes too long to leave pocket and seek refuge under duress.,Backup
2022,Bailey Zappe,"Stocky pocket passer with eye-popping production in high-volume passing attacks. Zappe is a confident passer willing to challenge both man or zone coverages on all three levels. His release quickness and arm strength are both below average and he might not work with the anticipation or decision-making prowess to overcome those areas of concern. He's unimpressive physically and lacks precision accuracy, so finding work as a backup might be a longshot despite the impressive career production.",Prolific pass production. Great feel for his scheme and isn't easily rattled. Good pre-snap recognition of coverage and pressure points. Trusts his pocket and rarely voids it unnecessarily. Vision to exploit holes in the zone. Feels pressure off the edge and climbs pocket ready to throw. Alters trajectory on deep throws according to the coverage. Excellent deep ball touch. Functional mobility inside and outside of the pocket.,"Stocky and short for a pocket passer. Can get stuck on single-side reads. Operation time for delivery is slow. Lacks the arm talent for difficult, off-platform throws. Won't beat NFL coverage often enough on tight-window throws. Lackadaisical delivery causes accuracy issues in quick passing game.Basic ball placement and accuracy are spotty when moving his feet. Most interceptions came from poor decision-making.",Backup
2022,Sam Howell,"Stocky, three-year starter who plays with admirable confidence despite inconsistencies in important areas as a passer. Howell attacks the field working from deep to short when he's allowed. He's not a classic full-field reader at this point but has pocket poise and mobility to potentially develop in that area in the future. He muscles throws, hindering his accuracy on drive throws but has adequate arm strength and can expedite off-platform throws. Howell doesn't throw with nearly enough timing or ball placement, which forces wideouts into the boundaries or to break stride, limiting their YAC potential. He flashed impressive dual-threat talent in 2021, which should work in his favor. The 2021 tape was bumpy but his makeup is really good and improvement is likely with better pieces around him. Howell isn't wired for or suited to a ball-control passing attack and might need a vertical passing scheme capable of creating explosive plays in order to succeed.",Gamer tendencies since freshman season. Confident demeanor leaks over to teammates. Has some sandlot talent when pressed. Climbs pocket with scanner still clicked on. Adequate decision-maker reading combo routes. Can get to his third read across the field. Looks for explosive throws outside the pocket. Nimble dealing with foot traffic. Zip and multiple arm slots for off-platform throws. Took yards with his legs rather than forcing throws in 2021. Red-zone value as a runner. Frisky with shake to elude and pop to finish.,Squatty frame and tightly bound limbs. Ball pat and windup slow the release. Touch and timing both need work. Muscles the throws with upper body causing the ball to sail. Falls off the throw unnecessarily. Gives safety a head-start to make plays over the top. Deep balls come out late and a little flat. Placement issues make receivers work hard. Lacks accuracy on drive throws. Needs to trust his eyes and cut it loose. Takes too many unnecessary sacks.,Low End Starter
2022,Chris Oladokun,Oladokun offers good arm talent and an ability to throw on the move and off platform. His placement and anticipation need work and he's noticeably better throwing between the numbers than outside them. He plays with plus pocket mobility and can extend the play when needed but must become a better decision-maker and field-reader to have a chance at the next level.,Possesses NFL arm talent and an expedited release. Was a better deep-ball passer than stats would indicate. Deep throws come out without much effort. Throws with confidence when he's on the move. Shows ability to sit down and drive throws into windows. Pocket mobility buys additional time to search for throws. Caught two touchdown passes in 2021.,Started every game in only one of five seasons. Gets stuck on one side of the field with his reads. Coverage recognition can be a problem. Anticipation as a passer is slightly below average. Ball placement on intermediate throws needs work.,Backup
2022,Skyler Thompson,Thompson's passing production hasn't been overly impressive and his health has been an issue over the last two seasons. He has a decent arm and can make plays on the move. He's a decent field-reader who doesn't take too many unnecessary chances but he's also not going to make enough plays. The age and lack of consistent production as a passer hurt his chances.,Shows ability to work through progressions. Reads coverage on combo routes with timing. Resets feet on the move to deliver from his platform. Arm talent to make rollout and scramble throws with success. Delivers deep ball with adequate touch. Maneuvers around the pocket and locates his target. Won't take many unnecessary chances with the football.,"Will be a 25-year-old rookie. Very average passing production over his 40 starts. Below-average accuracy on drive throws. Over-strides and sails the throw. Forces receivers to break stride and work for it. Throws need to come out with better anticipation. Fails to fully explore passing options when he hits the red zone. Missed chunks of time due to upper body, knee and ankle injuries since 2020.",Backup
2022,Brock Purdy,"Four-year starter who was never able to improve upon a stellar sophomore campaign. Purdy is a burly pocket quarterback who needs a play-action based offense where he can rely on timing over release quickness and arm strength. He can be a confident passer when he finds his rhythm, but throwing is more of a chore than a talent thanks to a labored release. Certain areas of the field will be off limits as he moves up to take on NFL coverage talent. He's a scrappy runner but not dynamic enough to make up for his shortcomings as a passer.",Four-year starter and team leader. Different quarterback when he finds his rhythm. Makes his way through progressions. Strong hands allow for easy pump fakes to move defenders. Generally accurate passer between the numbers. Confident throwing over linebackers and in front of safeties. Good toughness and anticipation as a runner. Willing to dive to move the chains.,Pocket setup lacks quickness. Field blinders occasionally rob him of seeing the big play. Delivery is labored. Lacks timing to beat NFL corners outside the numbers. Shies away from tight-window throws. Ball needs to come out sooner on deep-ball shots. Confidence and consistency have been issues.,High End Starter
2021,Trevor Lawrence,"Refined and polished for his age, Lawrence is the ultimate prototype for today's brand of franchise quarterback. He has great size. He also possesses elite pocket-passing qualities paired with dual-threat athleticism that makes him an unpredictable weapon on every down if play-callers are willing to expand their playbooks for him. While he's fairly polished with his approach from the pocket, he has better improvisational talent than many of the quarterbacks who have come up through the quarterback camp circuits from a young age. He has the arm and eyes to make all the throws and to create explosive plays from outside the pocket. There are some areas of concern, though. Lawrence's poise, decision-making and accuracy all took a hit in 2020 when he was forced to work under pressure. His performance against Virginia Tech showed there is still room for improvement with how he processes his options against the blitz. There were times when he looked encumbered by his play-action-heavy, shotgun offense. Getting away from that system could help him post-snap. He's generally a smooth operator, with an abundance of experience and tape against high-level competition over three seasons. His body of work should give NFL teams a clear view of who he is and the type of player he could become. Lawrence has an extremely high ceiling and a floor as a very good player who will start for a long time.","Played rare volume of high-leverage games as three-year starter. 86-4 record as a starter dating back to high school. Commanding presence with unmistakable air of confidence. Elite size, athleticism and play traits. Dual-threat capabilities will add to his explosive play totals. Speed, wiggle and toughness for zone-read and called runs. Understands how to protect himself. Feet stay calm when working from pocket. Subtle pocket slides to stay pass-ready and on platform. Internal clock helps him stay on schedule. High-level escapability when pocket collapses. Pinpoint accuracy on basic throws. Sticks short throws into run-ready placement. Ability to generate sudden torque for drive velocity. Arm to challenge safeties and work into tight windows. Willing to take punishment to deliver throw with poise. Alters arm slot to sling it around incoming bodies. Capable of altering touch and trajectory when needed. Unlikely to opt-out into checkdown prematurely. Delivers lasers to the back shoulder.",Benefits from heavy play-action and quick game. Offense limited amount of full-field reads asked of him. Inconsistent eye manipulation of safeties. Play can become frenetic when pressure arises. Struggled deciphering blitz and coverage packages against Virginia Tech. Has ball dip in his passing delivery. Can improve in throwing receivers open. Sailed a few more throws than expected. Will make ill-advised throw over taking sack on occasion. Average deep-ball placement. Will need to incorporate a slide into his game as a runner. Threw an interception in five of his last six games.,High End Starter
2021,Zach Wilson,"Ascending quarterback prospect who possesses the swagger and arm talent to create explosive plays inside and outside the pocket. The gunslinger's mentality and improvised release points are clearly patterned off of one of his favorite players, Aaron Rodgers. However, his play is a little more reminiscent of a blend between Jake Plummer and Johnny Manziel coming out of college. As with Manziel, too much of Wilson's work comes off-schedule due to inconsistent anticipation and a desire to hit the big play. But like both Manziel (at Texas A&M) and Plummer, he's mobile with the ability to extend plays and hit the chunk play. Wilson's sophomore year tape shows troubling decision-making, so NFL teams will need to balance his 2019 and 2020 production in the evaluation process. He's put in a lot of work to get to this point and has the potential to become a good pro. However, he might need to play with a more disciplined approach to reach his ceiling.","Enormous jump in production and play quality in 2020. Outstanding 11:1 touchdown-to-interception ratio in 2020. Offers potential as full-field reader. Arm looked substantially more lively in 2020, with highlight-reel throws on the move. Slick ball-handler in quick game and RPOs. Twitchy operation time to get it out and easily alters arm slot if needed. Generates sudden drive velocity for seam throws. Throws with some accuracy working off-platform. Sticks throws into Cover 2 windows with great conviction. Unafraid of making tight-window challenges. Gives big targets a chance to make plays on 50/50 balls. Deep and intermediate accuracy (54% and 68%, according to PFF) was outstanding. Feels pressure bearing down off the edge. Able to make subtle pocket slides and stay throw-ready. Athletic play extender with big-play mindset outside the pocket. Has mobility to keep defenses honest.","Level of competition allowed for ""bombs away"" mindset in 2020. Struggled with accuracy and decision-making against Coastal Carolina. Carries ball down by waist as pocket scanner. Has tendency to over-stride and sail throws at times. Hero ball needs to be dialed back a bit. Passed up on the easy throw to take the harder throw. Doesn't work with enough anticipation as a passer. Will baby throws, forcing open receivers to break stride. Ill-advised throws under pressure turned into interceptions in 2019. Went 2-4 against top-25 teams during his career.",Backup
2021,Trey Lance,"One-year starter who dazzled in 2019. Lance is mature for his age, but will be just 20 years old at the time of the 2021 NFL Draft. He's a rare dual-threat quarterback in that he's tasked with setting his own protections and reading the full field. Coaches rave about his football IQ and film work. They believe he will come into the league more football savvy than most of the quarterbacks in this draft. Tape shows very average arm strength but velocity should improve with better lower-body drive. While his recognition of coverage danger is a plus, he's currently more of a ""yellow light"" quarterback who needs to find a ""green light"" risk-taking mentality to become a playmaking talent in the NFL. An offensive coordinator willing to blend his run/pass talent with a play-action attack could get the most out of Lance, who should become a good NFL starter.","Film junkie with high football IQ and an NFL frame. Makes calls to set his own protections. Bouncy feet for accelerated pocket setups. Play-fake aficionado from under center, causing defenders to consistently bite. Passing scheme encourages full-field reads. Processes progressions very quickly and can work to his fourth read when protected. Able to mentally recalibrate his attack when play comes off schedule. Taking care of the football is a priority for him. Rarely takes bait against zone defenders and safeties looking to pounce. Compact, twitchy release partially mitigates his windup. Makes attempt to throw targets away from coverage. Adequate anticipation on timing routes. Makes quality touch throws into sideline buckets and over linebackers. Knows his way around pocket and can make sudden escapes. Above-average speed, athleticism and power when heâs on the move as a runner. Able to move the chains in a variety of ways.","Highly inexperienced with just 318 pass attempts under his belt. Will be 20 years old at the time of the 2021 draft. Gets a little lackadaisical with his feet in quick game. Needs to trust his pocket. Has a tendency to void pocket rather than sliding and surveilling. Pressure pulls his attention from deliverable throws. Needs to become more decisive and trust his eyes. Leaves lower half behind, diminishing his drive velocity. Occasionally leaves explosive plays on the field by not getting it out on time. Leaves too many deep balls short, allowing defenders to challenge. Can be overly cautious. Needs to get his slide game up and minimize collisions as a runner.",Backup
2021,Justin Fields,"Like Dak Prescott before him, Fields enters the league with dual-threat capabilities but is more of a pocket passer with the ability to extend plays or win with his legs when needed. He was up and down in 2020, but a bounce-back performance against Clemson -- including an impressive second half after suffering an injury -- said a lot about his toughness and leadership. He sees the field fairly well inside the Buckeyes quarterback-friendly offense but needs to become a full-field reader and prevent his eyes from becoming transfixed on primary targets. He sticks open throws with accuracy and velocity thanks to a sturdy platform and good drive mechanics. He's also comfortable throwing into intermediate holes of a zone. A slower operation time and a lack of a twitchy trigger will require him to work with better anticipation and pressure recognition pre- and post-snap. He takes more sacks than coaches will be comfortable with but he also digs his way out of holes and creates explosive plays. Fields operates with a quiet confidence and has experience overcoming adversity. He should continue to improve and become a solid NFL starter within a couple of seasons.","Toughness/willingness to do what it takes is always on display. Never lost a Big Ten game as a starter. Vast improvement in 2020 with fumbles per snap. Good size with stout lower body to stave off sacks/tackles. Lateral footwork to side-step downhill blitzers. Usually finds a firm, sturdy passing base beneath him. Plenty of zip for long, field-side throws. Attention to drive mechanics generates velocity when needed. Makes quality reads when deciphering high-low concepts. Confident and comfortable throwing into intermediate zone windows. Willing to take a big hit to deliver a pass. Good command and accuracy on boot action to the right. Keeps defenses honest with his legs. Picks up tough yards on the ground when team needs it.","Needs to improve pocket mobility for clean launch points. Below-average feel for edge pressure, running himself into pressure points. Field vision is average in face of the blitz. Missed open blitz beaters in the middle of the field against Indiana. Gradual operation time prevents expedited release. Needs to release ball earlier on anticipatory throws. Needs to improve eye manipulation as a pro. Stagnant eyes invite coverage to the passing party. Forces receivers to slow for deep throws. Pet spin move as runner got him clocked against Clemson.",Low End Starter
2021,Mac Jones,"Jones has above-average accuracy and a season full of eye-catching production. He displayed nice improvement as he grew into the position from 2019 to 2020. His accuracy and ball placement stand out and he throws a very catchable football with consistent touch on it. He's not much of an improv player but can hurt defenses with his feet once he leaves the pocket. The tape shows too much predetermined decision-making about where he wants to go with the football rather than letting the coverage and his progressions speak to him. While the production looks great, he has clearly benefited from a wealth of riches up front, in the backfield and at wide receiver. He has a tendency to play with some panic when pressure gets after him and could struggle when things aren't optimal around him. Jones has good backup to low-end starter potential.",Stepped up to the challenge in 2020. Won't take unnecessary chances very often. Feel for pocket slides to avoid pressure. Can climb into a rhythmic drive throw. Very confident making placement throws. Feathery touch attacking over the top of linebackers. Accuracy to prevent receivers from having to break stride. Expedites release on hot reads and in the face of pressure. Perfect placement with hanging it high for receiver to leap and make plays. Shows flashes of throwing players open. Wins at the back shoulder. Willing to get rid of the ball rather than take a loss or make a mistake. Some elusive qualities when he turns into a runner.,Very thin lower body and struggles to fight off rush contact. Slow ball handler on RPOs. Leaves back half behind in his follow-through. Average release quickness. Locks in on a target rather than honoring the progressions. Doesn't play with the desired poise of an NFL starter. Antsy when reads don't quickly come together. Play can be panicky and rushed in the face of pressure. Has trouble locating open targets in direction where heat is coming from. Would like to see him play with more grit.,Low End Starter
2021,Kyle Trask,"Trask clearly has the arm strength, touch and placement to wear out one-on-one coverage if he has good protection and above-average players around him, but he's not going to elevate an offense with his talent alone. He's very good at finding his throwing platform and can deliver deep throws with outstanding touch. He needs to improve his eye work to create more opportunities by moving safeties around. Trask is clearly a skilled passer, but it's hard to find evidence of him being able to play chess at this point against what NFL defenses are likely to show him.",Prototypical size to stand tall and fire from the pocket. Made substantial production gains across the board in 2020. Enabled team to open up game plan in 2020. Became the first FBS quarterback in 15 years to post three or more TD passes in nine consecutive games. Stepped up against Alabama in SEC Championship Game. Able to pump and reset against baiting coverage. Feels edge pressure and climbs to free space in pocket. Gets back into passing platform when moving outside the pocket. Arm strength to whip field-side deep outs with no issues. Tardy safeties will find a willing challenger over the top. Talented downfield passer with touch and accuracy. Can attack one-on-ones and place deep throw where it needs to go. Fairly accurate even when feet are not set.,"Pocket setup is slower and labored. Footwork gets sloppy and bouncy inside pocket. Needs to do better at recalibrating optimal targets post-snap. Will miss blitz recognition and basic reads at times. Threw into bracketed coverage multiple times against LSU. Deliberate release will not tolerate slow reads through progressions. Below-average functional mobility to extend the play. Unlikely to improvise and beat defense if he's not well-protected. Appeared to favor left knee, affecting follow-through. Runs targets into traffic and collisions with late-ball delivery.",Backup
2021,Kellen Mond,"Quarterback with dual-threat physical tools who has grown and matured into a role as a confident game manager. The Aggies' offense asked too much of Mond in the past, which led to diminishing returns. However, the 2020 offense featured a strong rushing attack paired with play-action, where he not only found greater confidence and rhythm as a passer, but also noticeable pocket poise and accuracy. He doesn't often get antsy working from the pocket and throws with solid ball placement underneath. Issues with touch and anticipation create erratic completion numbers when asked to throw down the field and outside the numbers, which will concern evaluators. His zone-read talent and quick release to incorporate RPOs adds to his draft value, but he might lack the consistency to ever become more than a solid backup.","Four-year starter with growing confidence. Improved game management and ball placement in 2020. Touchdown-to-interception ratio jumped from 2:1 to 6:1 in 2020. Has become willing pocket passer who trusts his protection. Quiet lower body when working through progressions. Delivers most throws from balanced platform. Alters arm slot to deliver ball around bodies and arms. Quick, wrist-flick release generates tight spiral with quality zip. Relatively accurate throwing on the move. Dangerous zone-read option. Able to break the pocket and move the sticks with chunk play scrambles.",Deep throws are often flat and overthrown. Highly inconsistent in working with anticipation. Doesn't consistently make defenses pay for coverage mistakes. Shies away from big-play opportunities to take shorter throws. Will miss late safety movement indicating incoming blitz. Defaults to aiming rather than throwing at times. Just average attacking high-low route concepts. Inaccuracy and indecisiveness reared ugly heads against LSU. Completed just 35 percent of intermediate throws outside the numbers (and 26 percent of deep throws outside numbers) in 2020.,Backup
2021,Davis Mills,"There isn't going to be an excessive amount of tape on Mills, but teams will see a player with below-average mobility, good size and plenty of arm talent for passing attacks looking to open up the entire field. Mills is still in the developmental stage as it pertains to his ability to command the offense and play chess against coverages and blitz looks. He's made for a play-action attack that can promote his timing as a passer and help keep him protected. The injury background and lack of experience are potential stumbling blocks, but the talent is better than the production and worthy of a middle-round pick for development as a good backup to low-end starter.","Highly regarded recruit who might be coming into his own. Prototypical size for a pocket passer. Has experience working under center. Quality footwork creates rhythm as a play-action passer. Arm talent to challenge Cover 2 windows and rifle deep outs. Snaps lower half into release, adding to drive velocity. Throwing motion is buttery smooth and effortless. Ball comes out with some zip on a tight spiral. Works with impressive anticipation for an inexperienced quarterback. Frequently cuts it loose when target is just getting in or out of break. Squares hips and shoulder as rollout passer. Releases deep out when receiver is coming out of break. Can dodge free runner off the edge and collect himself to find a receiver.",Just 11 career starts under his belt. Surprisingly low touchdown total relative to attempted passes. Below-average pocket climb and mobility. Needs to read route combinations and allow them to mature. Modest operation time to load and fire. Poor ball placement eliminated touchdown opportunities. Has a tough time coming off of primary read at times. Needs to develop eye discipline to hold safeties. Too willing to fling ball into populated coverages. Plays with some alarm from pocket when internal clock goes off. Below-average escapability from pocket pressure.,Low End Starter
2021,Ian Book,"Notre Dame's winningest quarterback brings plenty of leadership and overall intangibles with him. He has big game experience in his background, too. However, his size and arm strength fall below NFL standards and there isn't anything in his game that he can really hang his hat on that counters those issues. He makes receivers work too hard for the catch and was dreadful throwing outside the numbers in 2020. He's effective in RPO calls. He also does a nice job of feeling pocket pressure and sliding around it or getting outside the pocket to make plays. He's a capable runner and a plus athlete but doesn't have the necessary play traits to make a splash in the NFL.",Three-year starter and two-time team captain. Leadership is important to him and he's highly respected by teammates. Feet are quick in his setup on play-action. Climbs pocket when he feels the edge caving in. Footwork and ball-handling for RPOs. Expedites his operation process when he reads hot. Hangs in tough to deliver throws in face of impending hits. Throws the football with good touch and catchability. Escapability to make plays outside the pocket. Slippery runner once he's inside the red zone.,Needs to get through his progressions faster. Has issues with indecisiveness at times. Carries ball low in the pocket and throws with a windup. Lacks arm strength to make all the pro throws. Will struggle to zip it between linebacker and safety. Completion totals were abysmal outside the numbers. Not a natural anticipatory thrower. Ball placement is inconsistent. Has issues air-mailing throws way over targets. On the shorter side by NFL standards.,Backup
2021,Sam Ehlinger,"Highly touted dual-threat quarterback from the Austin area who put together four solid but somewhat unspectacular years at Texas. They don't come much tougher than Ehlinger at the position, and his intangibles are as good as you could ask for. He's a very average passer, but can deliver most throws with good enough accuracy and velocity to hit the open target. He doesn't have a plus arm and could struggle to fit throws into tight windows or make big completions throwing on the move. His deep ball accuracy is a step below average but he's fairly effective throwing with anticipation on intermediate routes. He's not an explosive runner, although he gets tough yards on a consistent basis as a scrambler and on called runs. His 2019 tape is a better study of his potential, but career backup looks like his ceiling.",Full-time starter for three-plus seasons. Well-built frame is durable and strong. List of intangibles is off the charts. Has experience with leading through adversity. Plays with dirt-dog toughness as a quarterback. Trusts his pocket but knows his way around it. Excellent climb and slide away from pressure without dropping his eyes. Displays adequate arm talent to make NFL throws. No fear in standing and delivering the throw in the face of pressure. Has become better decision-maker and more decisive over the years. Possesses value as a willing and able runner. Able to go get physical yardage near goal line or to move the chains.,Defaulted to hero ball a little too often in 2020. Took too many chances rather than making the smart play. Carries the ball low while scanning in the pocket. Elongated dip and wind release. Gives safeties early jumps by locking in too early. Tightly muscled with some restriction in follow-through. Deep balls could use more air and better accuracy. Will take unnecessary sacks by holding the ball too long.,Backup
2020,Joe Burrow,"People's champ with rags-to-riches story arc culminating in one of the greatest one-year turnarounds in sports history. He's self-assured and plays with competitive toughness that teammates will gravitate toward instantly. He's a rhythm passer who benefited from tempo and scheme, but his vision, touch and read recognition made the offense special. He buys time for himself inside the pocket, but creates explosive, off-schedule plays outside of it with his arm or legs. He throws with staggering precision and timing, but he recognizes his own arm-strength constraints and is forced to shrink the field accordingly. His 2018 tape and unremarkable physical traits could clutter his evaluation for some, but he appears to be an outlier who simply developed and blossomed beyond those evaluation concerns. He's a smart quarterback with special intangibles and could become a Pro Bowler if a team tailors its offense to his specific strengths and comfort level.","Off-the-charts football IQ and intangibles. Plays with brazen field presence and poise. Rapid ascension to chess master who can beat up coverages thrown at him. Initial field glances are often lies being told to safeties. Gets through full-field progressions with unique internal clock timed to the routes. Decisive from read to release with elite precision and placement. Stuck it into impossible windows on several occasions. Very good timing and anticipation. Throws pass-catchers away from coverage and into space. Throws with superb touch and trusts receivers to make the play. Deep dime-dropper, completing 55 percent with 24 TDs and 2 INTs in 2019. Separates from rush with deft climbs, slides and escapes. Above-average toughness in pocket and as runner. Unexpected wiggle to elude when scrambling. Makes explosive, off-schedule plays while on the move. Can deliver back-breaking runs to move the chains.",Polar opposite seasons in 2018 and 2019. A level of scheme fit is necessary. Below-average arm strength and average release quickness. Tends to work into more condensed areas of the field. Steep drop in accuracy on intermediate throws outside the numbers. Requires top-notch timing for out-breaking throws as a pro. Saw nose of ball dive on some throws field-side. Spotty high/low combo throws against long boundary CBs when they play it low to high. Early issues handling Clemson's disguised blitz packages. Scheme created clearer reads and easier one-on-one throws. Took sacks he didn't need to,Franchise QB
2020,Tua Tagovailoa,"Talented dual-threat quarterback with winning background, explosive production and loads of experience in high-leverage games. He may be pigeon-holed into a spread or RPO-heavy attack, but he's actually a clean fit in a pro-style attack filled with play-action and roll-outs. He has the release, accuracy and touch needed to work all three levels successfully and can become a more disciplined, full-field reader to piece the puzzle together against NFL coverages. He needs better poise when pressured, but his escapability not only moves the chains, it creates chunk plays in the air and on the ground. Teams assessing his draft value will need to sift through mounting durability concerns and decide whether he is a ""face of the franchise"" talent without the abundance of talent surrounding him.","Fits the mold of NFL's new dual-threat quarterbacks. Career touchdown-to-interception ratio of 8:1. Sudden ball handling on RPO plays. Active, agile feet offer quick setups and re-sets. Rare upper-body twitch allows for fast release.

Two ankle surgeries, hip surgery, broken nose and concussion as starter. Can improve anticipatory throws and timing. Failed to recognize easy throws to developing routes. Inconsistent squaring feet to back-side reads. Constricted delivery limits zip he can put on throws. Forces open receivers to break stride more than he should. Poise in and out of pocket can be spotty. Hurries into frenetic throws with moderate pressure at times. Fails to sit and finish delivery when he's going to be hit. Needs earlier pocket slides to stay ahead of the pressure.",High End Starter
2020,Justin Herbert,"Big, talented full-field scanner able to find the right read and sling it around the yard from the pocket or on the move. Herbert rushed throws in 2018, but he showed marked improvement in that area, excluding the Auburn opener. He trusts his protection while working through coverages and route development and has big-boy arm talent and drive velocity to stress and impress defenses. He's confident attacking downfield, but touch throws evade him and may have created tentativeness with certain short and intermediate throws. Ball placement requires additional emphasis, but upgrading to NFL skill talent could help him bloom. Herbert has a high ceiling and is the most physically gifted quarterback in the draft, but he doesn't have as many ""wow"" plays as expected for someone with his traits, experience and potential.","Great size with filled-out, pro-ready frame. Full-field reader with experience in pro passing concepts. Operates with pre-snap plan and recognizes matchup advantages. Play-actions are bought and sold. Ball tucked near frame when scanning. Scans crisply through full slate of progressions without panic. Eyeballs deep safety, keeping him planted midfield. Played with better poise and calmer feet than in 2018. Throwing process is well-balanced, quiet and repeatable. Rocket arm can beat rangy safeties and keep tight windows alive. Able to alter arm slots to work around traffic. Fluid stride and throw rolling in either direction. Has zone-read ability and can roll downhill once he's flushed from the pocket. Put three rushing touchdowns on Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl.",Disappointing impact as passer over final four games. Play is more mechanical than maestro. Scouts say he leads by example but is not a commanding presence. Has issues finding touch on his tool belt. Flat throws found linebackers with interceptions/deflections. Toggles between caution and worry attacking first two levels. Uneasy challenging zone corners on high/low combos. Needs to trust his eyes and let it go in rhythm. Ball placement to lead receivers can be better. Deep shots and fades need more air under the ball. Struggles to escape sudden pressure.,Franchise QB
2020,Jordan Love,"Challenging evaluation for quarterback-needy teams balancing traits and potential against disappointing 2019 tape. Staff turnover and new starters across the offense are partly to blame for his regression, but self-made flaws in process were also concerns. Love's accuracy took a step back, and his delayed reaction from ""see it"" to ""throw it"" when making reads is troubling. He has the arm to stick throws into tight windows but needs better eye discipline and anticipation to keep windows open. His size, mobility and arm talent combined with his 2018 flashes could be a winning hand that leads a team into the future or a siren's song of erratic play and unfulfilled potential.","Tall in the pocket and smooth, natural thrower. Keeps ball tucked and secure while scanning the field. Tight spirals come from a variety of arm slots. Offenses built upon intermediate and deep reads/throws. Confident passer attacking between the hashes. Makes athletic pocket exits when scrambling. Good open-field vision and speed to move the sticks. Arm strength to dime it into windows.

Too much staring and telegraphing. Six games with multiple interceptions, including three pick-sixes. Below-average decision-making against zone looks. Allowed coverage to swarm due to lack of anticipation. Unusually spotty ball placement forced targets to work for catches. Completed just 31.8 percent of his deep throws. Doesn't slide to safer launch points enough. Will void viable pockets at times. Needs to use eyes to hold safeties longer. Issues bringing in off-target snaps, leading to fumbles.",High End Starter
2020,Jalen Hurts,"Like Tim Tebow, Hurts is a winning dual-threat quarterback known for his strength, toughness and character. Hurts is a more accurate passer and better runner than Tebow but is inconsistent as a decision-maker and tends to break the pocket when throws are there to be made. His deep-ball touch and intermediate accuracy improved this year so teams may see him as a developmental talent who will keep getting better in the right scheme. He'll struggle to beat NFL defenses from the pocket, but his ability to grind out yards on the ground and make off-schedule plays should make him a solid backup with upward mobility.","Finished with 38-4 record as a starter. Tremendous leadership qualities. Extremely tough and durable. Shows poise to make plays late in games. Has experience in a variety of schemes. Able to step and drive with adequate velocity. Uses athletic ability and strength to elude pocket pressure. Play extender who can make big plays on the move. Good accuracy on intermediate passes. Capable as rollout passer. Talented, powerful runner from direct snap and RPO. Leg drive to move piles and fall forward behind his pads.","Has issues sustaining rhythm as passer with so many off-schedule throws. Inconsistent patience allowing routes to develop. Slow recognition of early throw opportunities. Leaves slants and crossers behind targets. Misses checkdowns and opts for harder throws.

More likely to void pocket than climb, scan and throw from it.",High End Starter
2020,Jacob Eason,"His elite size and arm talent are reminiscent of Carson Palmer, but issues with pocket poise and getting through progressions cleanly are more reminiscent of Brock Osweiler. Eason is fun to watch when he's ripping throws around the field and taking deep play-action shots, but a lack of mobility inside and outside the pocket is troubling, considering his ineffectiveness when pressured. He's relatively inexperienced and should continue to develop from the pocket, but poise is hard to fix, and handling exotic blitz packages is not a given. He's a pro-style, play-action-based quarterback with average starter potential and an average backup floor.",Strapping pocket-passer prototype. Has frame and arm strength to excite evaluators. Accuracy is his working default on most throws. Can step and rip it between two levels of defenders. Velocity helps mitigate average anticipation. Arm strength to challenge secondary anywhere on field. Deep-ball accuracy on play-action shots. Alters trajectory to outpace trailing coverage deep. Big hands secure the football through contact. Willing to hold and throw through edge pressure. Disguises screen intentions.,Deep dropbacks hurt his pass protection. Setup for quick outs and slants takes too long. Inconsistent timing on intermediate throws. Needs to trust the route runner and avert gaze early on. Was highly ineffective under duress. Fails to expedite his process when pressure mounts. Shows tendency to drop eyes and panic against the interior blitz. Below-average escapability and running talent. Takes sacks rather than getting rid of the ball. Needs to improve footwork and discipline for full-field reads. Circles up and out of the pocket if half-field reads aren't open.,Backup
2020,James Morgan,"It's easy to tell that the Green Bay native favors quarterbacks like Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers when you watch his tape. Unfortunately, while he has similar zip to the Packer legends, he's nowhere near as accurate and lacks any semblance of touch. Morgan is very capable of making impressive throws to all areas of the field, but his violent release and inconsistent footwork hinder functional ball placement and accuracy. His lack of pocket mobility and instincts make him too easy for defensive coordinators to assault with a variety of blitz packages. However, some teams view Morgan as the only true developmental quarterback talent in this draft, and that could make him a middle-round pick.","Very tough player.

Completion total ravaged by excessive drops in 2019. Above-average hand size. Can spin the ball with just a flick of the wrist. Few windows are too tight for his velocity. Can fling strikes into the teeth of the defense. Shows ability to expedite his delivery when needed. Flashes major league arm talent.","Style makes it hard to find a consistent rhythm. Rarely gets through a slate of progressions. Fastball pitcher lacking accuracy in the strike zone. Hips fly wide open in his delivery too often. Throws short passes as hard as any quarterback ever. Throws into contested spots rather than throwing receivers open. Lacks necessary pocket mobility to find clean launch points. Turns into a pass-rush punching bag unnecessarily. Deep safeties read his eyes and shade his throws. Carries football low, creating pocket fumbles.",Backup
2020,Jacob Fromm,"Heady quarterback who is light on physical traits but sees the game like a pro signal-caller most of the time. Fromm has big-game experience and proved to be a worthy challenger against Alabama as a freshman and sophomore. He's a full-field reader who has shown a consistent ability to change plays and make smart pre- and post-snap decisions. Arm strength is a concern, and that concern may be exacerbated if his ball placement and timing aren't more consistent. He's an intelligent game-manager whose range is good backup to middling starter, but he will be scheme- and skill-position-needy at the next level.","Typically unrattled in high-leverage battles.

Had five-game run where he failed to complete 50 percent of his passes. Will be heavily reliant upon skill-position talent. Below-average mobility.",Backup
2020,Jake Luton,"Luton is an intriguing developmental quarterback with good size, adequate accuracy and an NFL arm. He's operated in a pro-style passing attack with plenty of play-action and has the ability to push the ball into space both intermediate and deep. He values the football with few fumbles and interceptions during his career, but he's more of a ""ball delivery"" passer than one who works through progressions and picks the defense apart.

He doesn't have much of an arm so he needs to work with plus timing and extreme accuracy in order to avoid interception trouble in the league. He scans the field with good coverage recognition but will sit on his primary target a little long at times. His athletic ability is intriguing, but he must prove he has functional arm strength and enough poise in order to make it on a roster.","Ball comes out with a consistent, tight spiral. Operates with plus ball placement and touch throwing in space. Plays with good recognition of the coverage. Athletic talent to elude and extend the play. Comfortable throwing on the move without a decline in accuracy. Had 16 rushing touchdowns in just two seasons. Has speed to hurt teams on zone-read and quarterback scrambles.","Thin through his lower half. Just one 300-yard passing game over 29 starts at James Madison. Sixty percent of his attempts in 2019 were inside of 10 yards, per PFF. Has a tendency to overreact to pocket pressure and void prematurely. Arm strength doesn't match his eyes. Will struggle throwing into tight windows. Needs to have better eye discipline to hold safeties longer.",Backup
2020,Tommy Stevens,Stevens has outstanding size and speed for the quarterback position but lacks the functional skill to make his living primarily as a passer. He's a dual-threat quarterback with a surprising burst for his size that pops off the screen on zone-read gallops and when escaping the pocket. He lacks the field-reading and timing needed to beat NFL defenders but could have a shot in a hybrid-athlete role where he also handles short-yardage carries and plays special teams.,"Big and athletic. Might have potential to operate as a gadget player, similar to Taysom Hill. Above-average open-field instincts as a runner. Has size to drag tacklers after initial contact at times. Very good size-to-speed ratio. Carries a gunslinger's velocity as a passer.",Dual-threat who lacks passing profile of an NFL quarterback. Has to prove he can commit to a hybrid role in the league. Needs to keep ball tucked tight on the move. Doesn't have special teams experience. Will air-mail throws over the receiver's head. Lacks field vision to recognize trouble. Anticipation is below average as a passer.,Backup
2020,Nate Stanley,"Big guy with a good arm who throws with nice touch to intermediate and deep windows, but failed to convince that he could manage games and play with an NFL level of consistency while at Iowa. The physical tools and traits are appealing and potentially moldable, but he may need plus talent to elevate his play rather than the other way around. Stanley has moments where he is comfortable in a pro-style attack, but struggles to find a rhythm in the short passing game. His indecisiveness and lack of mobility could make him a sitting duck against NFL defenses and might limit him to backup status.",Possesses NFL-ready height and frame. Works with pass-ready footwork/platforms in the pocket. Arm talent to work into challenging windows on all levels. Can generate 60-yard throw when off-balance. Effortless throwing motion and follow through. Showed off deep-ball accuracy in 2019. Ability to alter delivery and touch attacking seam and sideline.

Lacks early bounce to elude pocket pressure. Is not a threat to run as a pro.,Backup
2019,Kyler Murray,"Severely undersized, one-year starter with rare playmaking talent that could force general managers to reassess long-held notions about size and style for a franchise quarterback. Murray is like a complex burgundy with notes of Baker Mayfield, Johnny Manziel and Russell Wilson in his play, but like any quarterback, he'll need to prove he can recognize disguised coverages and work on-time from the pocket to go from flash talent to playoff winner. Teams drafting him need to have the right coordinator and must be committed to framing their offense specifically to Murray's strengths and weaknesses, which could require additional roster re-configuration. Murray is an electric talent with a live arm, good mental makeup and the skill-set to produce at a high level in the right offense.","Never seems to get rattled or overwhelmed. Showed ability to elevate his play in clutch situations. Plus runner and passer as true dual-threat quarterback. Twitchy ball-handler for instant delivery from RPO reads.

2019,Daniel Jones,"Three-year starter who operates with a rare level of quality mechanics coming from the college game. Jones doesn't have special arm talent, but he can make pro throws and has the ability to attack deep with accuracy. He completed just 59.9 percent of his career passes, but his receivers -- who dropped 38 passes this year alone -- really struggled to get open at times. Jones has good football IQ and is relatively mobile, but he appears to be more of a game manager than ""franchise"" talent. He's more of a Day 2 draft pick than Day 1.","Benefitted working under QB guru David Cutcliffe at Duke. Did more with less at skill positions. Quick worker through progressions. Early recognition of deep ball opportunities and feathers throws into the target. Adjusts pre-snap plan to blitz and exploits hot-read opportunities. Consistent footwork from pocket with feet following eyes. Outstanding accuracy on intermediate throws. Uses fastball when he needs it, but generally throws with touch. Drives field-side throws with velocity. Courage to hang in the pocket and throw despite impending blow. Completion percentage hurt by high drop rate. Displays feel for pressure off the edge. Good athlete with scrambling ability to move the chains. Slick pocket slider with ability to keep searching for target or flee for yardage.",Thin in his lower body.

Needs to work ahead of schedule more often on next level. Succumbs to off-platform tosses rather than working into better positioning. Showed willingness to throw it up for grabs rather than take sack. Loose ball handling in face of pressure leads to fumbles. Too much bravado as a runner. Took licks when slides or dashes out of bounds were options.,Low End Starter
2019,Dwayne Haskins,"Big and talented with explosive arm talent but limited mobility Haskins is a chance-taker with the arm strength to get away with some tight window throws that most in this class can't make. Haskins is still very early in his journey and is prone to misreading coverage and stalling in getting through his progressions. While this is normal for an inexperienced quarterback, Haskins is going to be forced to learn on the fly against NFL speed and defensive coordinators conspiring to defeat him. His athletic limitations could keep him pocket-bound, but he has the arm talent, confidence and pocket savvy to become a good NFL starter if he's protected and given the time to develop early on.","Groomed for this moment since he was young. Rare passing production. Has been mentored by NFL receiver Mohamed Sanu. Well-schooled with understanding of how to get himself protected. Will bet big to win big. Confident to take chances and complete game-changing throws. Shows potential to be a full-field reader on NFL level. Effortless throwing motion.

Has to be willing to come off primary reads when coverage dictates it. Needs to expedite his process in the face of pressure. Needs better feel for when to throw with touch. Accuracy on the move is below average. Below-average athlete who can't run away from trouble. Sluggish, heavy feet when he scrambles. Fumbles due to carelessness and lack of concentration on snaps.",Backup
2019,Drew Lock,"Full-field reader offering prototypical size and arm talent, but one that has a concerning lack of accuracy and consistency against top opponents. Inside of each game, Lock makes reads and throws that are worthy of an early pick. There will also be plays in the same game that highlight his random inaccuracy and issues defeating pocket pressure. He has as much pure talent as any quarterback from the 2018 draft, but he won't reach that lofty potential unless he improves his accuracy and learns to play with better in-game presence.","Prototypical combination of size and arm talent. Full-field reader with ability to scan and process with good quickness. Pocket movements are sudden and twitchy. Exceptionally quick ball-handler with sudden release. Throws with anticipation. Fearless and confident to make challenging throws down the field. Fires ropes through constricted seams and in cover-2 buckets. Uses eyes to move safeties. Rarely lingers on primary targets, preventing defenders from getting early jumps. Decent deep ball touch and accuracy and gives his receivers a chance. Low sack total due to mobility and feel for edge pressure. Maintains field vision when he's on the move.

Production falls off a cliff when forced to move his feet. Inconsistent squaring to throw when on the move. Poise and decision-making appear tied to level of pressure he sees. Drifts back and away from the rush and forces himself into low-percentage throws. Lamb-killer with just 14 TDs and 7 INTS against SEC opponents in 2018. Confused and unsteady against Alabama and Georgia with multiple turnovers.",Low End Starter
2019,Will Grier,"Grier benefited from the West Virginia system, but that same system definitely benefited from his time there. He is a confident leader who would much rather press for the big throw than play it safe underneath. His lack of plus arm talent and release quickness might not match his gunslinger mentality against an NFL secondary. Grier will have to win from the pocket, which means working the middle of the field with better anticipation and getting rid of the ball much sooner. His disappointing Senior Bowl and combine performances have likely hurt his stock.","Highly organized and known as galvanizing locker room guy. Plays with attacking, downfield mindset.

2019,Ryan Finley,"While Finley's accuracy, production and mode of operation has been static over the last three years, his ability to improve in all areas has been impressive. He works well in a controlled environment, reads alignments and knows where the ball should go, but he failed to elevate his production against the best in-game competition and then again at the Senior Bowl. His intelligence and accuracy could find him work as a quality backup with the potential to find some future starts.",Full-field reader with experience in pro-style passing attack. Recognizes coverages and crafts a pre-snap plan. Uses eyes to bait safeties and disguise his intentions. Stands in against imminent rush harm.

Throws receivers away from lurking defenders. Sticks it on the back shoulder when needed. Alters touch and trajectory to throw between defenders in the seam. Accurate deep-ball passer who floats it into the basket with proper touch. Functional scrambler with feel for edge pressure in the pocket.

2019,Jarrett Stidham,The 2017 Alabama win showed a mobile quarterback with good mechanics and intelligence who played with confidence and was able to convert in key situations. The 2018 tape shows a player who lost both his confidence and poise and began to play a rushed brand of football that seeped into his pre-snap planning and his post-snap accuracy.

Needs to throw with better anticipation. Average operation time to throw. Unlikely to beat defenses with arm talent alone. Needs to step and drive his throws. Ball placement and accuracy fell off in 2018. Below-average deep ball accuracy.,Backup
2019,Easton Stick,"Revered team leader whose tenure was marked by consistency and success. Stick was a dual-threat quarterback within his team's offensive scheme, but he lacks the wiggle to wear that label as comfortably in the NFL. He's mobile both inside and outside the pocket and has the ability to work with timing from the pocket. His lack of arm talent and his struggles during practices at the Shrine Game will likely work against him.",Rare three-year team captain and undisputed team leader.

2019,Gardner Minshew,"Minshew's ascension from unheralded graduate transfer to Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year is indicative of the enigma he is in the 2018 draft. He might not have the desired traits, but he has very good intangibles and accuracy.

2019,Trace McSorley,"Gritty, successful three-year starter who fell victim to a disappointing regression during his senior season. McSorley is a dual-threat quarterback who lacks size and arm talent but has shown an ability to throw with anticipation to help overcome his average arm strength. While McSorley can handle RPO duties, he seemed to be more comfortable and accurate when sitting down on throws from the pocket.

Mayfield falls into both categories and has to prove he can transcend those perceived deficiencies on the next level.

2018,Sam Darnold,"At the end of the day, Darnold has NFL size, arm strength, accuracy, pocket mobility, poise and field reading capability. His windup is an eyesore for sure, but he has the velocity to mitigate the additional release time. While Darnold has the mental toughness and talent to start tomorrow, early sideline seasoning could help him better process coverages in an attempt to eliminate future interceptions. Darnold has the tools to thrive in any system and doesn't have to have perfect protection to succeed. His floor is solid starter, but he has the ceiling to be one of the top tier quarterbacks in the game as he gains more experience.","Has desired NFL size.

2018,Josh Allen,"Likely be the biggest boom-or-bust quarterback prospect in the draft. Allen's size and arm talent are prototypical for early first-round picks, but it's rare to find a quarterback with such a low college completion rate become a successful pro. Allen's receivers struggled to separate, but there were plenty of times where his lack of anticipation and post-snap plan did him in.

Needs to play smarter and place higher value on the ball. Fastball pitcher whose touch could use improvement short. Will baby the deep throws at times. Field-reading is spotty. Needs to be more patient in allowing combo routes to develop. Would benefit by trading some velocity for better timing. Anticipatory throws don't seem to come naturally.

Frequently defaults to off-platform throws when there is time to set feet and deliver.",Franchise QB
2018,Josh Rosen,"Josh Rosen's footwork and mechanics make him as pretty a quarterback as you will find in this year's draft. The biggest concern with Rosen is that his on-field success requires many elements to stay on schedule. He lacks plus arm strength, so identifying coverage (pre- and post-snap) and throwing with anticipation takes on added importance. Rosen has the pocket poise, accuracy and intelligence to become a good NFL starter, but he needs to be willing to take what defenses give him more frequently. Rosen will need to quell concerns surrounding leadership and coachability early on in order to establish a strong first impression and get his career off on the right foot.",Tennis prodigy with impeccable footwork and delivery balance.

2018,Lamar Jackson,"Evaluating Jackson against the NFL standards for the position will cause him to come up short. However, he has rare speed and athleticism and can single-handedly win games. Jackson's accuracy is clearly spotty and teams must decide the level of accuracy they are willing to live with relative to his ability to create explosive plays. Jackson may need to operate in an offense ready to integrate RPOs (run/pass options) along with heavy play-action. Like Deshaun Watson in 2017, Jackson has the ability to counter mental mistakes and turnovers with a high number of explosive, touchdown-making plays.

Lackadaisical in setup. Throws with excessively narrow base and stiff front side. Flips it rather than throws it. Makes targets work too hard. Sails throws that can end up in hands of a safety. At times, hesitates to challenge safeties in the seam. Low release point leads to tipped passes. Typically gets through reads 1 and 2 before halting progressions. Pocket awareness has room for improvement. Move accuracy on rollouts and scrambles is poor. Highly inaccurate with throws on the move throughout the 2017 season. Underthrown deep balls allow cornerbacks to play the ball. Lacks touch over the heads of middle linebackers into intermediate pockets. Turnover total still too high.",Franchise QB
2018,Mason Rudolph,"Pocket quarterback with good size who has shown consistent improvement as a passer. Rudolph is more of a downfield, play-action passer than a quarterback who can win with precision and arm strength. He's a capable field reader who has the ability to operate with timing which will be important since his arm can be dull at times. Rudolph could be an early backup with the potential of becoming an average to below average starter in the league.",Great size and stands tall in the pocket giving him his true height as a passer. Does a good job of letting routes develop and wide receivers clear traffic. Slides in pocket for clean launch points and is rarely a static target for rushers. Keeps eyes trained downfield when sliding around pocket. Got rid of the ball quicker and cut his sacks this year. Willing to throw in front of safeties and attack over top of linebackers in intermediate portion of field. Has steadily improved each season and showed full command of the offense this year. Saw 10 percent of his dropbacks turn into 25-plus yard completions. Puts air under his deep throws and gives receivers a chance to make plays. Reads safeties and moves to his progressions accordingly. Ran zone reads around endzone and finished with 17 rushing touchdowns during career. Willing to drop his head and go get what he needs.,Over-strides at times. Rarely drives lower body through the throw causing ball to sail and float. May not generate enough velocity to beat ball-hawking corners who strangle passing windows. Field-side outs will be a challenge. Needs throws to stay on schedule. Needs to throw with better timing and placement on comeback and outs. Defaults to off-platform throws when he has time to step and deliver. Ball placement and decision making can run askew when forced to scramble from pocket. Ball will come out wobbly at times. Inexperienced as rollout passer. Benefitted from ball-winning targets downfield. Wasn't asked to get through many progressions in the offense. Has had ball security issues as a starter.,Low End Starter
2018,Mike White,"White saw major downturns in every important passing category this year, but evaluators will have to balance his inconsistent play against the porous protection he got. White has good size and a live arm which is enough to get him drafted, but if he doesn't do a better job of recognizing blitzes and making decisions faster, his arm talent won't matter. White has QB3 potential with a shot to move up the ladder as a backup.",Arm talent is the first thing you notice. Former high school pitcher with 90 MPH fastball who can crank up that heat when he needs to. Has good drive accuracy. Able to push the ball into tight windows. Has velocity and accuracy to attack the middle of the field. Can alternate between heat and touch. Throws catchable deep ball and has ability to drop it over a cornerback's head down the sideline. Can be dangerous from the pocket when he's protected. Completed 57 percent of his deep throws when protection was better in 2016. Resets feet before throwing when he leaves the pocket. Asked to make full-field reads at times.,Heavy feet take time to set up in the pocket. Struggled to deal with poor protection. Lacks feel for pressure off the edges and drops his eyes when he sees pocket push. Pocket mobility is poor. Was responsible for his share of the 46 sacks. Sluggish processor when initial reads are covered. Stayed on covered targets rather than finding better options. Relies too heavily on arm over anticipation. Looks lethargic when trying to roll and throw. Fumbled 12 times this year and 17 times over two seasons.,Backup
2018,Luke Falk,"Tall, rhythm passer with good natural accuracy and years of quality production who is much more comfortable working the perimeter and against man coverage. Falk's lack of protection and average mobility has lead to a tremendous amount of sacks and quarterback hits that may have taken a toll on him. While he can throw with touch and accuracy, his deep and intermediate accuracy dipped this season. There are some holes that could be hard to correct in Falk's game and ""average starter"" may be his ceiling.","Tall quarterback who stands tall in the pocket throughout the rep. Can see over the murk up front. Quick setup in the pocket with bounding, easy feet. Possesses a quick, compact release. Spins a pretty spiral. Gets ball out instantly and accurately on short throws and throws in front of him. Shows an ability to attack one-on-one defenders with accurate fades and back-shoulder throws. Able to work from sideline to sideline with his progressions. Accurate timing throws on deep outs are second nature after years in this offense. Has arm talent to uncork accurate strikes when falling off-balance. Able to slide in all directions inside pocket to buy additional time. Throws very catchable ball that hits receivers in stride. Will look-off high safety out of position to open the middle of the field for a post throw. Throws with plus ball placement.","Quick release disguises inconsistent arm strength. Field side throws and attempts to deep middle will float allowing defenders time to close. Needs to work on driving ball with lower trajectory between the hash. Too willing to make ill-advised, off-balance throws down the field. Inconsistency with anticipatory throws is a concern. Waits too long to cut it loose leading receivers into oncoming traffic. Slow to see blitzers and misses hot routes. Mobility is below average. Sacked 125 times in his career. Pocket poise took downturns at various points during season. Decision making stalls out after getting through early reads. Majority of interceptions came against zone. Nonchalant short touch throws defaulting to back foot releases. Must prove he can win beyond his system. Almost 74 percent of his pass attempts were less than 10 yards.",Backup
2018,Tanner Lee,"Despite a low completion percentage and high interception total at Tulane, there was a buzz surrounding Lee when he opened the season as the starter at Nebraska. In his season at Nebraska, it was the same story with Lee struggling to decipher moving pieces effectively resulting in the same issues he had previously. Lee has a shot of getting drafted and making a practice squad on his traits alone, but his issues with processing and anticipation probably can't be corrected.",Experienced working from under center with NFL size. Sells play-fakes and has arm strength to air it out over the top. Deep ball has some touch. Arm talent is a big plus. Able to rip tight spirals into small windows. Has an accelerated release. Can challenge and defeat tight man coverage on a good day. Goes from set to shoot in a moment's notice. Possesses coveted physical traits.,Atrocious touchdown-to-interception total of 46:37 for his career. Brings trouble upon himself. Throws with very little anticipation or timing. Allows throwing windows to close before taking his shot. Doesnt allow play design to work for him and misses wide open targets. Willing to fling it off his back foot. Oblivious to edge pressure and freezes under duress from interior rush. Redzone output was poor. Lacks attentiveness to safeties.,Backup
2018,Danny Etling,"Etling has decent size and an NFL arm, but his mechanical inconsistencies -- often brought on by impending pressure, are big concerns moving forward. Etling will have to prove he can improve his poise in the pocket as well as his ability to win with his progressions and decision-making after the snap. Etling may find an invite into camp, but will face long odds in making a roster.",Tall in the pocket with ball tucked in position for quick trigger. Release quickness is good. Played in passing scheme allowing for intermediate and deep passes. Throws the deep ball with good air under it and above-average accuracy connecting on 43.9 percent on throws of 21-plus yards. Takes care of the football and posted low interception rate in both seasons as LSU starter. Has arm strength to make all the NFL throws.,"Shows pocket panic when edge pressure is bearing down. Too willing to run up inside the pocket rather than slide and scan. Inconsistent squaring feet with eyes as he scans. Footwork, arm slot and follow-through are erratic unless he's in rhythm. Struggled badly with intermediate throws completing just 43 percent of his attempts. Doesn't appear ready to attack the play design. Fails to see wide-open receivers down the field.",Backup
2018,Logan Woodside,"Woodside is an undersized quarterback with a very average arm who overcomes his deficiencies with good football intelligence and above average accuracy. His lack of size will be an immediate turn-off for most teams, but his competitive nature and ability to throw it where he wants to could give him an outside shot of finding work for a West Coast offense that values his accuracy and decision-making.",Gritty and determined. Has been an underdog quarterback from high school to college. Naturally accurate on all three levels. Posted adjusted completion percentage (eliminates throws behind the line of scrimmage) of 65 percent with 73 touchdowns over last two seasons. Throws with necessary ball placement to pick at man coverage. Able to throw targets open. Good recognition of coverages and decision making is solid. Ball comes out on time and with some anticipation. Game against Miami wasn't too big for him. Gives his receivers a chance to make a play. Has adequate pocket awareness and mobility.,Falls well below NFL guidelines for size. Weighed just 206 pounds at NFLPA game. Big touchdown total from 2016 appears to be an outlier. Benefitted from offense designed to make deep safety a non-factor. Feasted on one-on-one downfield matchups. Long-strider in his delivery. Release features a small windup. Floats throws to field side. May not have the arm strength to make all the NFL throws. Struggled in postseason throwing three interceptions in his bowl game and just average week of NFLPA practices.,Backup
2017,Mitchell Trubisky,"Trubisky is a high-end quarterback prospect who possesses NFL size, a big arm and the ability to throw with accuracy from the pocket or on the move. Despite playing in a spread-based offense, he's a full-field reader who does a very good job of getting an early read on the safeties before crafting his course of action. Trubisky will have to become much more pocket aware and do a better job of recognizing and attacking blitzes to back NFL defensive coordinators off. He hasn't put all the pieces together yet, but the puzzle is all right in front. Trubisky projects as a good starting quarterback with a high floor and the potential to be great.","Adequate height with good muscular definition. Built to withstand physical challenges of the position. Calm field general. Very good pocket mobility. Can slide around circumference of the pocket without having to drop his eyes from their task. When he leaves the pocket, looks to challenge with his arm before defaulting to his feet. Always in ready-to-rip throwing posture. Delivery is crisp and efficient. Locates safeties and reads their intentions immediately after the snap. Quick through his progressions and will double back to targets if his protection allows him time. Pocket mechanics and throwing motion are solid. Tough and competitive. Shows courage and poise in the pocket. Throws passes from balanced platforms and rarely defaults to an off-balance throw unnecessarily. Has all the arm you need. NFL call sheets will be wide open with Trubisky at the helm. Can dial up deep field-side outs with accuracy. Ball comes humming out of his hand when he needs to spike his velocity. Arm talent to whip a catchable throw from difficult angles to targets outside the numbers. Makes the standard ""pitch and catch"" throws with consistent accuracy. Ball usually comes out on time. His 62.1 completion percentage on intermediate throws easily outpaces the top quarterbacks in this draft. Possesses get-away quickness to avoid sudden pressure from a-gap blitzers with the speed to damage the defensive cause once he leaves the pocket.",Almost 98 percent of his dropbacks came from shotgun. Will have to learn NFL footwork from under center which could take time. Benefits from offense loaded with RPOs (run-pass option) that pull linebackers forward and open easier throwing windows. Played in space-based passing attack that didn't often ask him to throw to tight windows in traffic. Arm slot will drop way down causing batted balls at line of scrimmage. Too willing to float balls rather than air-mailing them out of bounds when he's making a bail-out throw against pressure. Needs better drive accuracy between the hashes. Has a tendency to leave throws in hip pocket of moving targets. Inconsistent deep ball touch. Has touchdown opportunities he babies and invites defenders time to recover. Not always pocket aware. Hyper-focuses on shifting parts down the field and can be late to feel pressure collapsing the edges.,Low End Starter
2017,Patrick Mahomes,"Mahomes is a big, confident quarterback who brings a variety of physical tools to the party, but he's developed some bad habits and doesn't have a very repeatable process as a passer. Mahomes' ability to improvise and extend plays can lead to big plays for his offense, but he will have to prove he can operate with better anticipation and be willing to take what the defense gives him in order to win from the pocket. Mahomes will be a work in progress, but he's a high ceiling, low floor prospect.","Possesses NFL body type for work inside and out of the pocket. Has an undeniable swagger and confidence to his game. Accuracy has improved in each season since his freshman year. Naturally accurate in his every day throws. Comfortable challenging defenders in space. Has arm strength and fearlessness to attack the cover-2 voids down the sideline. Can make deep, field side throws. Cranks up velocity to fit passes into tight windows. Former pitcher who propels hips through his release with aggressive torque and never gets cheated on his follow-through. Can deliver strikes from a variety of arm angles. Expedites release on RPOs (run-pass option) or when pressure is mounting in pocket. Puts effort into play-action fakes. Relaxed and effective when throwing on the move. Can be a legitimate dual-threat in a boot-action offense. Improved his eye manipulation over the years and will eyeball linebackers to hold them while patterns unfold around them. Has pocket mobility to escape pressure and the poise to extend plays and find alternate targets. Hands are very strong. Can pump and reset without issues. Competes as a runner and is willing to go the extra mile for the first down.",Can be inconsistent in his approach. Needs to play inside the offense and show more discipline. Too eager to go big game hunting. Ravenous appetite for the explosive play can also bring unwanted trouble. Willingness to default to playground style appears to limit his ability to get into a consistent rhythm. Needs to improve anticipatory reads and learn to take what the defense gives him. Decision making can go from good to bad in a moment's notice. Operates from a narrow base and allows his upper body and arm to race ahead of his feet. Has a dip and wind-up in his standard release. Explosive delivery and follow-through causes some throws to sail. Needs better touch on intermediate and deep balls. Carries ball a little low in the pocket. Impatient. Will leave pocket prematurely rather than standing in and winning in rhythm. Better as a scrambler than pure runner. Looked a little less mobile in the open field this season.,Franchise QB
2017,Deshaun Watson,"Teams will have to weigh the inconsistent field vision and decision-making against his size, athleticism, leadership and production. While not perfect, teams can add checks to both arm and accuracy boxes for Watson. However, discussions about whether or not his areas of improvement can be corrected will likely determine whether a team will view him as a high-upside prospect or a franchise quarterback. Watson's transition from Clemson's offense to a pro-style attack will obviously take time, but his combination of intangibles and athletic ability make him worth a first-round selection.","Tremendous leader and winner. Good pocket posture with quiet upper body. Good pocket mobility and doesn't show much panic when pocket gets noisy. Sacked just 32 times over his last 1,181 drop-backs. Willing to stand in and deliver the ball against rib-wreckers on a clear path for him. Has history of clutch play in big games and big moments. Averaged 472 yards of total offense with eight total touchdowns and one interception in his two championship appearances against Alabama. Throws with anticipation and touch. Fires hips through throws for improved drive velocity into tight windows. Arm strength currently limited by mechanical issues that are correctable. Big, strong hands to pump fake and manipulate. Keeps ball tucked near his chest when scanning. Has compact, over-the-top release that uncorks a tight, pretty spiral. Throws with adequate accuracy on the move. Has traits to operate out of boot-action attack. Tremendous athlete who has ability to pick up chunks of yardage on ground. Has called running plays could ignite a stagnant offense. Has instant juice out of pocket to make defense pay if rush lanes are vacated. Does a good job of sliding or eluding square collisions in space as a runner. Dual-threat weapon near end zone who will create additional preparation time for coaching staffs looking to limit his effectiveness in the red area. Every meaningful passing stat improved in close-and-late situations in 2016.","Frame is a little more slender than teams typically like. Accuracy runs hot and cold. Tends to over-stride on drive throws, causing release point to drop and balls to sail. Ball placement on crossing routes and slants needs to improve. Will leave throws behind intended targets. Deep-ball accuracy has been scatter-shot over his last two seasons at Clemson, with throws sailing well beyond his target. Design of offense limited his need to make full-field reads. Has to become adept at working through progressions and playing chess against safeties. Needs to let routes develop rather than rushing anticipatory throws. Too many interceptions due to lack of vision, placement or decision-making. Threw interception vs. Troy against bracketed coverage he didn't see. Baited into bad-decision interceptions twice by Florida State cornerbacks. Has issues improvising away from initial, pre-snap plan even when pathway to target becomes muddy. Shotgun quarterback who, like Jared Goff, could take time getting used to huddling, pace of play-calling and drop-backs from under center.",High End Starter
2017,DeShone Kizer,"The comparison to Steve McNair could raise eyebrows, but that is based primarily on size, mobility and arm strength. The aforementioned traits often land a quarterback in the first round, but Kizer's second-half drop in production combined with inconsistent decision-making and accuracy should be a speed bump for teams ready to jump in head-first on the traits. Kizer has the ability to become a quality starter, but has to improve his ball placement and field vision first.","Big quarterback with a big arm. Can make all of the throws. Has step and crank power to drive throws into the seams. Has the arm talent and willingness to challenge safeties on both intermediate and deep throws. Looks the part with thick frame to withstand NFL punishment. Over the top delivery creates tight spirals. Has powerful grip allowing for aggressive pump fakes to move defense around. When he's comfortable, will tie feet with his eyes as he scans the field. Adequate drive accuracy. If he feels a completion is imminent, he'll stand in and take a punishing shot. Strong, authoritative runner with the speed to hit a big play with his feet. Two-way threat in the red zone. Posted 18 rushing touchdowns over last two seasons.",Gets stuck on primary read missing out on early openers around field. May not have eyes or compact release to spot and hit flashing targets. Can be too reliant upon arm strength over mechanics. Wants open throwing window rather than operating with early anticipation. Can improve in leading receivers and throwing stationary targets open. Too hesitant. Gets caught in pump fake vortex at times. Quick to drop his eyes and halt progressions when pocket warms up. Inconsistent decision-maker. Showed dreadful lapses in judgement that lead to interceptions. Too willing to make off-balanced heaves. Benched against Stanford. Had at least one interception in 15 of his 23 starts. Will take a sack despite having ample time to read and throw.,Backup
2017,Davis Webb,"System quarterback with more than 65 percent of his attempts coming inside of 10 yards. Webb has enough raw talent to be considered a developmental prospect, but his decision-making and accuracy issues beyond 10 yards is a big red flag that might be tough to overcome in the NFL.",Stands tall in the pocket with a high release point. Rhythm passer. Can drive it with accuracy between hashes when allowed to sling from a clean pocket. Shows patience to allow crossing routes to clear traffic. Expedites release with compact delivery when blitzed. Functional poise with blitz in his face. Slides to create cleaner platform to launch from when pocket gets noisy. Internal clock is operational. Has feel for when ball has been in his hands too long and will look to release it. Feet are good enough to operate in a boot-action passing attack. Completion percentage saw an uptick in the fourth quarter in 2016.,Robotic decision-making. Decision on where to go with ball seems predetermined despite coverages. Needs to get better at manipulating safeties with his eyes. Inconsistent velocity to sideline causes nose of ball to dip. Drive throws sometime sail. Has slow setup in pocket with excessive pre-release steps. Cornerbacks contest too many throws due to lack of anticipation. Timing passes must come out sooner. Plagued by accuracy issues and decision-making outside the numbers on both intermediate and deep throws. Five of his 12 interceptions in 2016 were along deep sidelines due to under-throws and failure to read safety help. Touch and placement are an issue when forced to leave the pocket. Not a factor as a scrambler.,Backup
2017,CJ Beathard,"Pro-style quarterback who dealt with nagging injuries to key pass catchers and himself in 2016. His 2015 tape was more impressive, but deep-ball accuracy issues, poor pocket awareness, and unnecessary hesitation as a passer shows up in both seasons. Beathard plays checkers with safeties rather than chess, which could always hinder his ability to attack down the field with success. Could be a career backup who finds himself in the action at some point down the road.","Played in pro-style passing attack, working under center and from shotgun. Capable and confident rolling out. Squares shoulders to deliver strikes. Completed 57 percent of his passes outside of the pocket at Iowa. Showed improved touch on short throws. Footwork and pocket mechanics look solid. Throws with some natural accuracy despite pedestrian completion percentage. Better tape in 2015 as he had to overcome injuries to key targets in 2016. Has the arm strength to throw the deep out without laboring. Trusts his line and keeps eyes downfield. Plays with relatively calm demeanor. Good feel and timing for screen game. Knee brace slowed him some during senior season, but he has ability to escape the heat. Team leader with ability to handle adversity. Won't take unnecessary chances.","Hesitation is a noticeable issue. Often late to pull trigger on throws toward the sideline, forcing receivers into boundary and out of the catch. Slow field scanner who tends to lock into a single side. Too much eye-balling and not enough manipulating. Poor feel for pocket pressure. Two-year sack total of 58 is too high in play-action attack. Anchors deep in pocket and rarely climbs pocket to safe harbor. Oblivious to backside pressure until it's too late. Needs more air under the long ball. Deep-ball accuracy has been terrible. Completed under 30 percent of throws beyond 20 yards in last two seasons at Iowa. Completed just 43 percent of throws beyond line of scrimmage to right sideline.",Backup
2017,Josh Dobbs,"Dobbs is hardly incompetent as a passer, but he hasn't shown as much growth with his ball placement and accuracy as scouts had hoped to see from this former four-star prospect. Dobbs has decent size and is an outstanding runner outside the pocket which could appeal to a team looking for a developmental quarterback with play-making ability.",Has the ball handling and release quickness to get the ball out early when challenged by sudden pressure. Able to get through progressions to the check down option. Throws a tight spiral with adequate drive velocity. Eye-catching deep pass accuracy (47.7 completion percentage) with 14 touchdowns on throws 21-plus yards. Displayed good mental toughness. Can make timely exits from the pocket and win with his feet against overzealous rushers who vacate their rush lanes. Has explosive ability as a runner. Offers a team packaged-play potential in short yardage situations.,Could use more weight on his frame. Below average delivery balance affects his accuracy and ball placement. Footwork is uneven and causes him to throw from unbalanced platform too often. Throwing motion causes him to push some throws. Floats the deep out allowing defenders to close out his passing windows. Decision making not where he needs it to be. Can't always get away from poor looks once he's made his mind up pre-snap. Threw nine interceptions on just 104 attempts beyond 10 yards this season.,Low End Starter
2017,Nathan Peterman,"Peterman's experience in a pro-style passing attack gives him a head start headed into the league. His physical attributes are just average, but his accuracy, composure and anticipation are what sets him apart from some of the more physically gifted quarterbacks in this year's draft. Peterman's tape is sure to catch the eye of at least a few teams in need of a quarterback and he should come off the board by day two with a chance to become a solid starting quarterback in the future.","Smooth, quick set-up in pocket. Grips the ball with big, 10-inch hands. Poised in pocket and takes the hit to deliver a completion. Will set-up, slide and then re-set before making his throw. Can cut it loose from off-balance angles from bootleg or play-action if he sees a winning option break open early. Full field reader. Works all the way through his progressions. Shoots glances at safeties to keep them in check. Strong natural accuracy. Able to throw receivers open and lead them away from danger. Can pinpoint passes to moving targets in his intermediate work. Has enough arm to work field side, intermediate throws. Great vision. Sees passing windows before they develop. Throws with outstanding timing and anticipation. Can put the ball on receivers' hands as soon as they come out of a break if coverage dictates it. Utilizes accuracy and anticipation to challenge windows on all three levels. Won at Clemson hanging five touchdown passes on their talented stop unit. Good escapability and can extend drives with his legs. Excellent deep ball accuracy completing 46.2 percent of his deep throws.","Inconsistent delivery base causes some throws to sail. Has instances where he short strides and is forced to muscle it to his target. Will float some throws on seams and dig routes. Will have to be mindful to drive the ball on pro level to avoid the ballhawks who are lurking at safety. Has to prove he has enough arm to challenge the same tight windows he did in college. Ball handling a little sluggish in wide receiver screens, hitches and most RPOs (run, pass option). Wants to play hero-ball at times. Needs to learn when to air-mail throw and move to next play rather than trying to get too cute with sideline throws. Can improve overall touch.",Backup
2017,Brad Kaaya,"Groomed to be a quarterback from an early age, Kaaya flashes the mechanics and intelligence of a player who has spent hours in quarterback camps. However, he can be too mechanical and thinks too much rather than just flowing and responding to what the field offers him. Kaaya could have used another year of college, but he has the tools and intangibles to become an NFL starter. While he can work around his average arm strength, he must improve his accuracy and anticipation if he is to make a mark in the NFL.",Three-year starter and pro-style pocket passer. Experienced and comfortable under center and in play-action offense. Has shown an ability to read the entire field when asked. Gets through progressions fairly quickly. Expedites release and throws to an area in front of the route when blitz is closing in. Always looking to throw past sticks on third down. Understands his arm limitations and rarely takes unnecessary chances throwing into space. Rhythm passer comfortable working in timing-based passing attack. Schooled on mechanics of the position since he was eight years old. Uses well-timed climbs and slides to maneuver away from pressure. Footwork is consistent and well-rehearsed. Ball stays tucked under his ear until he cuts it loose with relatively quick wrist flick. Throws on balance with easy delivery. Delivers feathery soft deep ball with good trajectory and ability to drop the nose of the ball into a bucket. Gets ball out early on field-side throws to mitigate lack of velocity.,"Accuracy and ball placement can be sketchy. Will rush throws and ""work early"" rather than throw with velocity into tight windows. Front side opens early, causing passes to sail. Consistently poor accuracy on intermediate work. Completed just 38 percent of his passes between 11-20 yards in 2016. Underthrows deep balls and fails to consistently hit crossers and slants in stride. Arm strength lags behind NFL norm. Throws hang in air or nose-dive prematurely when throwing field side. Rigid, mechanical approach as passer. Lacks arm talent and improvisational skills to create magic with off-balance throws on the move. Fails to see and exploit anticipatory throws between linebackers and safeties. Lacks mobility outside the pocket and will give into the pressure -- at times taking the sack rather than getting rid of the ball.",Backup
2017,Chad Kelly,"He's hardly a scouting favorite based on reputation and inconsistency, but Kelly has attributes that could make him an eventual starter in the league if his personal and football character are kept in check. Kelly's competitive nature and willingness to challenge defenses will lead to some hot-and-cold moments, but there is some talent to work with there.","Good arm talent. Will make ""wow"" throws, especially early in games. Has shown an ability to make bold, anticipatory throws over the deep middle. Over final two seasons at Ole Miss, saw 13.6% of his pass attempts go for 20-plus yards, a higher percentage than both Deshaun Watson and DeShone Kizer. Can alter release to account for sudden shifts and movements by defense or his own receivers. Poise is good enough. Will pump, slide, and re-set his feet to make accurate throws. Can set up and fire quickly from the pocket. When he sits down on throws, will use lower body to drive the ball through his targets. Gamer with a competitive streak that runs deep. Touch throws are in his repertoire when attacking area between linebackers and safeties. Looks comfortable in rollouts and boot-action throws. Completed 66.7 percent of his passes when on the move in 2016. Shuffles to safe spots inside the pocket and is able to scramble out of pressure and find targets. Willing runner with runs of 43 and 41 yards over last two seasons. Attacks the middle of the field with accuracy and throws consistent strikes to stationary targets.","Lacks desired size and willing to take way too many hits outside the pocket. Has worked almost exclusively from shotgun and pistol. Struggles to maintain early success after halftime defensive adjustments. Completed just 2-of-12 deep shots down the left sideline in 2016. Under-throws some deep balls when trying to pass with touch. Inconsistent air under the ball. Saw interception percentage skyrocket when throwing to left side of the field. Woeful on back-shoulder fades. When pressure heads his way, he tucks and scoots rather than stands and delivers. Has random bouts of inaccuracy on wide receiver screens and outs. Throws nose-dive on move throws. Inconsistent working through progressions. Fails to see wide-open receivers, opting instead to make his job harder. Mind appears to be racing at times. Needs to manipulate safeties with lingering glares. Considered a character concern by some scouts; kicked off Clemson team for ""detrimental conduct.""",Backup
2016,Jared Goff,"While Goff is a little leaner in the lower body than teams might like, he has good size, an NFL arm, advanced pocket mobility and the field demeanor of a franchise quarterback. His accuracy and decision making will suffer from occasional lapses, but he displays the tools to become a good starting quarterback with time.","Quality arm. Makes all the throws and can sling the deep out with velocity and accuracy. Clean release and snaps throws off with flick of the wrist. Drives hips through his release for extra heat. Pocket mobility and poise showed improvement from 2014 to 2015. Maintains proper footwork and readiness to throw as he slides inside the pocket. Speeds up internal clock when he feels pressure or recognizes blitz. Pocket climber. Able to run out of trouble rather than into it. Looks the part of a confident, first round quarterback when working from a clean pocket. Sells his play ­fakes with purpose and draws linebackers forward. Has learned to expedite his throws from off­-balance angles due to pocket pressure. Will throw receivers open in tight quarters. Has excellent trajectory and pillowy soft touch on touch throws down the field that give receivers a chance to make plays. Showed substantial growth with his willingness to attack intermediate areas of the field and did so with accuracy and relative success. Completed an impressive 43.8 percent of his deep throws. Competes on third and long seeking out first downs over check downs.","Hits a rough patch with accuracy from time to time. Sails throws over intended targets especially early in games. Has spots where he makes receivers work too hard on easy throws. Spent 99.8 percent of his pass snaps from pistol or shotgun this season. Will likely need to orient himself with NFL footwork from under center. Rhythm passer who benefited from the up­tempo and ""quick game"" of Cal's Bear Raid offense. Has to learn fine line between getting ball out and rushing throws. Able to escape pocket, but isn't a proven finisher when on the move. Fumbled the ball 24 times over the last three years losing 11. Sacked 81 times over three years. Internal clock and poise will need to be monitored closely. Several of his interceptions came when he failed to read zone defenders underneath drifting up to challenge the throw.",High End Starter
2016,Carson Wentz,"With a body type that is as prototypical as they come and a background in reading the entire field and working through progressions, Wentz will immediately check a couple of boxes that many college quarterbacks won't be able to check. While his arm strength is OK, he can still make all the throws and he can make them with accuracy. His ability to escape pressure and pick up first downs with his feet will be yet another check mark in his favor. Wentz is still in a developmental phase after just two years at an FBS program, but has the mental and physical building blocks of a future, franchise quarterback.","Tall with an athletic, proportional build that is made for the NFL position. Played in a pro-­style attack with plenty of snaps under center. Asked to make NFL throws and showed he could do it. Stands tall in the pocket and delivers with a relatively high release point. Keeps ball high and tight in the pocket and can uncork it quickly with tight, sharp release and little wasted motion. Throws catchable ball with tight spiral. Naturally accurate passer. Sees lurking linebackers underneath and throws receivers open to safest spot in the passing window. Able to change arm slots and still throw a strike. Has plus deep ball accuracy and touch. Calm in pocket and has no problems sitting in and taking a hit to complete a pass. Excelled in structured passing attack that required him to read the entire field. Has athleticism to escape pressure and hurt defenses with his legs. Already able to feel pressure on the edges and slide around in pocket without dropping his eyes. Adept in play-­action game at selling fakes and quickly finding safeties to help determine where to go with the ball. Intelligent with long list of academic achievements. Should be able to process and handle an NFL playbook quickly. Can play pitch and catch all day long against zone coverage.","When rolling out, will float it a little too much when taking shots down the field. Allows passing windows to close quickly when he short­ arms his release. Needs a little more consistency on anticipatory throws outside the hash. Will get caught locking in on target bringing secondary charging in to make a play on the ball. Inconsistent footwork from the pocket. Arm gets ahead of his feet even with time to come to balance. Needs to pick up pace of his post-­snap setup. Has to put a little extra air on his field-­side throws. Can be a little flat with his downfield, touch throws. Has to eliminate the occasional nonchalant throw into tight quarters. Doesn't look comfortable yet with bootleg rollouts to the left. Broke a bone in his throwing wrist in October sidelining him for eight weeks. Dealt with arm and shoulder injuries as a baseball player in high school. Lower level of competition could cause issues for him adapting to NFL speed.",High End Starter
2016,Paxton Lynch,"While the hype around ""dual threat"" quarterbacks has subsided, Lynch possesses the size and athleticism to make NFL teams take a second look. Unlike other size/speed quarterbacks like Vince Young and Colin Kaepernick, Lynch prefers to extend passing plays with his feet rather than bolting from the pocket, but he is still likely to make plenty of plays with his feet over the long haul. Lynch shows the ability to read defenses and make smart decisions, but not yet at an NFL starting level. While he has the physical tools to start right away, a team who is willing to allow him to sit and study his craft for a year could reap maximum rewards in the future.","Very tall, athletic body with ability to scan over the top. Elite foot quickness for a tall quarterback. Can maneuver quickly out of a busy pocket and away from trouble, but desires to keep passing option alive. Sets up in the pocket quickly and generally keeps feet ""throw ready"". More functional scrambler than ""tuck and run"" quarterback. Sacked just 15 times over 477 drop backs. Able to win with his feet when he needs to. Has a quick release to overcome his slight wind­-up. Has enough arm to drive the ball into restricted windows. Has enough arm to attack downfield while on the move. Makes good decisions. Rarely takes the cheese when cornerbacks try and bait him. Displays qualities of a field leader and isn't easy to rattle. Yards per attempt have exploded over his last two years. Can gain chunk yards as zone-read quarterback and will appeal to boot­-action teams. Will be challenging to defend in the red area. Took better care of the football cutting turnovers down from 16 last season to just four this year. Completed 54.6 percent on intermediate throws (11­20) and 44.9 percent on deep balls (21-plus yards) including 19 touchdowns and just two interceptions.","Needs to improve ball placement for catch­-and­-run throws. Inability to throw with desired accuracy on the move forced him to leave yards and plays on the field. Must learn to better anticipate routes and stay ahead in the rep. Doesn't quite have the quickness through progressions that he will need in the pros. Has to learn to move defenders around with his eyes to open throwing lanes. At times, crowds targets against the sideline. Needs to stop babying play-­action passes and cut them loose. Consistency of arm strength has been overstated. Inconsistent weight transfer in delivery forces him to muscle some throws. Perimeter throws lack velocity and will nose­dive on him. His ball comes out with wobble and isn’t always the most catchable. Touch throws over inside linebackers needs work.",Backup
2016,Jacoby Brissett,"With his size, arm and competitiveness, there are times when Brissett will remind you of Jameis Winston, but Winston understood the nuances of the position early in his college career while Brissett is still learning. Brissett’s overall ability as a passer is NFL-­caliber and he should continue to show rapid improvement on the next level with better weapons and protection. While an NFL staff will need to help him overcome his bad habits and learn to be more consistent with his pre­-snap recognitions, Brissett has the tools to become an NFL starter.","Big quarterback with an NFL arm. Has the frame and lower body strength to shake off a would­-be sack and extend the play. Possesses competitive spirit and football character needed to be an NFL quarterback. Has a fastball and changeup. Able to step and drive ball into tight windows with plus accuracy or put feathery soft touch on throws when needed. Plays in pro­-style scheme. Has experience under center and is comfortable in boot-­action pass attack. Makes good decisions reading combination routes. Generally accurate passer who excels in intermediate throws. Wolfpack offense features a menu full of challenging deep outs and field side throws, but he has the arm, timing and confidence to handle it. Makes anticipatory throws into developing windows without flinching. Able to bolt pocket and challenge defenses with his feet. Ran less in 2015, choosing to challenge defenses with his arm after extending plays outside the pocket. Has arm talent, strength and moxie to make winning plays with defenders draped on him and completed almost 60 percent of his passes when forced to throw on the move. Rose to the occasion against Florida State in 2014 and Clemson in 2015.",Downward trajectory from over­-the­-top delivery causes some throws to sink. Has been severely pressured over last two seasons and developed bad habits because of it. Will drop eyes when he feels pressure and throws off his back foot as tools of survival. Occasionally muscles a back­foot throw despite having time to step and drive the ball. Still learning to calm feet and deliver rather than bail when defender is closing in. Carries ball low and away from body when scrambling. Has moments where he is oblivious to pre­-snap tells that blitz is coming off the edge. Needs to transition from always trying to fight through sacks to getting rid of the ball more quickly. Struggles with deep ball accuracy completing just 23.1 percent on attempts of 21-plus yards. Had several overthrows when tasked with deep throws down sideline versus man coverage. Failed to recognize receivers running wide open down the seam. Gets locked in on a pre­-snap plan and has issues altering his itinerary quickly.,Low End Starter
2016,Cody Kessler,"Can orchestrate an offense with confidence and accuracy when operating from a clean pocket, but doesn't appear to have the mentality of a player willing to take the risks necessary to strike with big plays often enough on the pro level. Kessler has moments where it is easy to like him on tape, but the traits and tape look more like those of a good, career backup than playoff starter.","Baseline accuracy is pro quality. Never had a completion percentage lower than 65 percent as a three-­year starter. Will take what the defense gives them and keep the chains moving. Able to play ""backyard catch"" with open receivers underneath if defenses let him. Delivered from the pocket with a 70.4 completion percentage rate. Adequate arm strength. Good general sense of running an offense. Gets through progressions quickly. Has pocket feel with ability to climb the pocket to throw or escape from side doors when necessary.","Just a shade over 6-foot-1, which is smaller than teams like. Below average move accuracy as a passer. Ability to hit targets with catchable throws falls off the table when forced to scramble. Doesn't show poise or arm strength for deep routes needing additional time to develop. Footwork unsettled by perceived pocket pressure. Tends to hesitate over anticipating and trusting his arm. Low-risk, low-reward approach. Rarely makes the ""wow"" throws with velocity or touch. Feet look jittery when moving from read to read.",Backup
2016,Connor Cook,"As a four-year starter, Cook has the big game experience and the production from a pro-­style attack that should warrant early consideration.The concern is that his short and intermediate accuracy has never shown the improvement and consistency that scouts expected to see. His inability to take over in big games this year could hurt his cause. Cook flashes the potential of an NFL starter, but he has the makeup of game manager over playmaker.","Four-year starter who has shown consistent improvement and added new elements to his game each year. Can operate with a high level of confidence and efficiency. Worked under center and plays with good foot quickness in his drops. Shows good anticipation for developing windows and effective with timing routes. Will continue to scan and re-­scan thru targets when on the move. Reads safeties early and rarely takes shots downfield that safeties can get involved with. Comfortable operating on the move. Throws in rhythm and with accuracy when rolling right. Plus arm strength with compact, lightning quick release. Able to make big boy throws with pace into difficult, dangerous windows. Will stand in and take the hit to challenge man defender with a deep shot. Attacks edges of end zone with touch throws. Didn't shrink away from duties when asked to run the ball. More battle tested than any quarterback in this draft.","Habit of throwing short passes with too much pepper. Accuracy is a major concern. Often caught flat- footed in the pocket and appears willing to launch throws without proper balance or step to target. Open front hip causes him to spray outside frame of his intended target. Sees throws come open but won't always cut it loose. Can struggle mightily when forced off of his first option. Misses opportunities to adjust protection pre-­snap. Gets locked in on shotgun snap and misses signs of blitzers sneaking forward. First instinct versus blitz is to go up top rather than finding easier, short completion. Gives little effort to sell play­ fakes even on run downs. Scouts question his field demeanor and leadership in adverse times. Failed to rise to the occasion in 2015 Big Ten Championship Game or playoff game against Alabama.",Backup
2016,Dak Prescott,"Hard to find an NFL comp for Prescott because he's built like Donovan McNabb, but lacks McNabb's ability and polish. Prescott has NFL size, mobility and enough arm, but the tape shows a player who must improve his mechanics, poise and quickness through his progressions if he is to become a full­-time starter in the NFL. There are absolutely draftable traits and upside, but he will need extended work to smooth out his flaws. Until then, a team would be wise to utilize him on short-yardage packages.","Thick, muscular frame. Has proven over last three seasons that he can withstand a pounding. Has enough natural arm strength and hip snap to fit throws into an NFL window. Stands tall and delivers a tight spiral with over-­the­-top delivery. Very little wind­up and gets ball out with the flick of a wrist. When pocket is clean, can deliver accurate strikes around the field. Played with improved vision and care for football this season and eliminated many of the ill-­fated throws that turned into interceptions in 2014. Still a work in progress, but continues to show a level of growth as a passer. Threat with his legs, scoring 37 rushing touchdowns over last three seasons and had 94 rushes of ten yards or more during that time. Can be used as goal-­line rushing option. Willing to extend plays outside of pocket with legs but look to finish the play with his arm. Mentally tough enough to carry a heavy offensive burden for the Bulldogs over last three years. When protected better in 2014, showed an ability to challenge deep and strike with accuracy and touch.","Beat up this year thanks to poor protection. When he wasn't being sacked, he was being hit hard. Not as competitive a rusher in 2015. Sacks and usage in run game might be taking a toll. Increase in short pass attempts from 86 to 208 this year reason for higher completion numbers. Accuracy on intermediate and deep throws dropped sharply. Pocket poise has been compromised. Hyper­ aware of pressure around him and lacks awareness to slide and find temporary shelter to make throw. Concern over pressure too often trumps ability to get through progressions. Must speed up the pace of his reads. Footwork is a mess. Slight stride onto stiff upper leg with little weight shift. Restricted follow through and too often tries to muscle throws with upper body. Throws to target rather than leading or throwing them open on short/intermediate throws. Too respectful of underneath coverage and must be more willing to challenge the defense. Needs to improve anticipation.",High End Starter
2016,Cardale Jones,"Jones is like a complicated meal that may or may not have all the ingredients present and will likely take a long time to prepare. Will the pay­off be worth the investment of time? Jones has very little starting experience and struggled to adjust once defensive coordinators had time to prepare for him this season. The right quarterback coach and passing scheme could promote rapid improvement and high-end production with his ability to strike downfield, but his issues with consistency and accuracy make the ""bust"" label a very real concern.","Great size to see over offensive line and bulk to withstand NFL hits. Pocket passer with as much arm as you need. Generates very good velocity without having to get feet set. Can rip it into tight quarters, challenge field-­side cornerbacks and attack safeties over the top. Almost 11 percent of his pass attempts were 20-plus yard completions. Completed 59 percent of intermediate throws and 41 percent of deep throws. Touch and ball placement on long ball is pro caliber. Can drop feathery, touch throws on fade routes. Has size, athleticism and toughness to call his own number in run game and is a chain mover as a scrambler. Interceptions generally due to overthrows and poor timing over bad decision­-making. Though not yet a strength, did show ability to get through progressions and find third option.",Handed starting job and never owned it. Disappointing accuracy issues with difficulty hitting simple slants. Uncorked interceptions where unrushed pocket throws sailed way over the top of targets. Eyeballs receivers and brings heat from instinctive linebackers and defensive backs. Had issues reading and reacting to zone coverage underneath. Doesn't hold safeties with his eyes. Failed to execute timing throws out in rhythm. Will pump and re­set too often forcing out routes against the sideline. Tends to overthrow near goal line and leave touchdown passes on the field. Saw completion numbers drop almost 30 percent when forced to throw on the move. Below average pocket feel and blitz awareness. Was unable to move from checkers to chess against defensive coordinators.,Backup
2016,Kevin Hogan,"Hogan has the size, mobility and quarterback's demeanor that could interest a team on the third day of the draft. He doesn’t have the arm that many teams look for and his intermediate and deep accuracy still need work. Hogan will need time and coaching to try and improve his mechanics and footwork if he wants to have a shot to be an NFL backup.","Consistent winner and tough. Scouts say his teammates and coaches see through deficiencies and trust the competitiveness above all else. Has NFL size. Benefited from playing in a pro­-style attack. Has adequate mobility and is unafraid to pull the ball down and get tough yards to extend drives. Extremely bright person. Doesn't always look pretty, but finds ways to make winning plays in adverse situations. Doesn't get cute and feeds his top talent. Tasked to manage the offense and did just that. Smart and self­-aware. Understands his strengths and weaknesses and doesn’t take very many low percentage chances. Was the most accurate short-yardage passer in Pac-12 at 76.7 percent.","Mechanics and footwork are a mess. Throws with a very wide base, a pitcher's stride and a protracted delivery. Ball rarely comes out of his hands cleanly. Plays flat­-footed in the pocket with little bounce as he scans field and does a poor job of re­setting and coming to balance before delivery. Below-average arm strength and struggles to consistently make accurate, catchable throws to the field side. Average at reading defenses, preventing him from getting ball out on time. Needs much more poise and pocket awareness. Had issues climbing and sliding to clean areas of the pocket when they were there. Drops eyes and immediately panics when pressure is mounting in his face. Took sacks he had no business taking. Lacking desired touch and accuracy on his deep throws.",Backup
2016,Nate Sudfeld,"Veteran quarterback with the desired frame for the position and coming off of his best year yet. Sudfeld tends to push the ball rather than deliver with a clean weight­ shift and follow through, creating inconsistencies with accuracy and velocity. There is some solid tape on Sudfeld that could give NFL teams hope, but issues with making the right reads will work against him.","Steps onto the field with terrific NFL size. Three-year starter who lead Big Ten in yards per pass play at 8.2 yards. Comfortable operating in timing based systems and shows ability to throw with desired anticipation. Ball usually comes out on time. Able to expedite throws when pressure finds him early. Feels pressure and gets rid of the ball over taking the sack. Makes catchable, accurate throws from the pocket. Shows off NFL arm when he steps and drives to target. Does not fear the field side throws and has arm and accuracy to make them. Puts plenty of air under touch throws allowing receivers a chance to make a play. Showed off consistent touch on deep corners. Competitive as a runner and lays out for first downs over sliding early.","Sets up with a very wide throwing base and slight dip in his delivery. Rarely gets full hip rotation through delivery forcing him to push throws. Touch in close quarters is below average. Field vision is only average. Inconsistent with reads against zone coverage. Makes up his mind and opts for tougher throws over open throws. Struggled in this way against Iowa. At times, rushes throws over sliding in pocket waiting for routes to develop. Saw substantial dip in completion percentage when rushed by five-plus defenders. Underthrows were culprit with deep ball accuracy. Not much of a threat with his legs.",Backup
2016,Brandon Allen,"Allen was an afterthought headed into this season but garnered draft attention with high­-end production and a substantial spike in his play. On one hand, he is smaller than teams usually like and operated out of a play-­action offense that didn’t ask him to get through many progressions. On the other hand, Allen has a quick release, an NFL arm, solid accuracy and good mobility. Allen needs to find the right home and eliminate his tendency to stare down targets, but he has enough talent to become an NFL backup.","Showed substantial growth as field leader and play­maker. Comfortable under center and is effective on bootlegs and rollouts. Completion percentage jumped from 56 percent in 2014 to 66 percent this year. Outstanding 64 percent rate on intermediate throws. Good catch­-and­-run ball placement on crossing routes. Sneaky arm talent. Able to pump fake, re­set and throw with accuracy. Swift setup in the pocket with a prompt release. Gets ball out in rhythm in rollouts. Rotates hips through throws for quality velocity. Arm to make NFL throws and has drive velocity and accuracy to challenge tight windows in middle of the field. Able to extend plays outside the pocket and find a throw or scramble for first downs. Doubled completions of 20-plus yards from 24 (2014) to 48 this year.","Smallish frame takes hard hits when he runs. Benefited from play-­action based passing attack. Just over 40 percent of his dropbacks were out of play­-action. Rarely looks to take deep shots down the sideline against man coverage. Not asked to get through very many progressions and brings safeties to his throws by staring down his targets. Could make life easier by moving safeties around with his eyes. When pocket heats up, he will drop eyes and look to bolt.",Backup
2016,Jeff Driskel,"Driskel still has the size, arm strength and athleticism that made him the top-­rated quarterback coming out of high school, but he hasn’t experienced enough growth at the position due to his rocky path to the draft. A positive 2015 helped Driskell regain some confidence, but he’s not where he needs to be yet. With his upside and traits, Driskel is worthy of a day three selection and could yield dividends with patience and coaching.","Prototypical build and athleticism. Quick­-footed signal-caller with rapid setup in the pocket. Has active, bouncy feet while turning and scanning from target to target. Possesses arm strength and pace on his throws to challenge play­making cornerbacks in man and instinctive linebackers in zone. Can get ball out quickly with the flick off his wrist. Fundamentally sound with good footwork to balance himself before driving the ball with good weight transfer and hip rotation. Dangerous runner outside the pocket and can escape with suddenness. Good open-­field speed and ability to operate in zone-­read packages. Willing to throw the ball away and move to next play rather than take unnecessary sacks. Accurate and confident in short passing game.","Struggles to lead receivers with throws, forcing them to break stride or adjust to throws behind them limiting their yards after catch. Short arms passes when throwing on the move causing issues with under-thrown balls. Accuracy drops substantially on throws down the field, with overthrows robbing him of big plays despite receivers having a step on cornerbacks over the top. Anxious when pocket gets turbulent and will occasionally feel pressure that isn’t there.",Backup
2016,Brandon Doughty,"There are several games where Doughty plays with confidence, great accuracy and a winning understanding of his offense. However, when the heat is on he shows a lack of poise that can affect his footwork and touch. Doughty is missing an NFL arm or plus athleticism, but his production and ability to get through his progressions will get him a shot to prove the ""system quarterback"" label wrong.","When he feels protected, can play a confident and intelligent brand of football. Strong understanding of the system and his options against every coverage. Reads safeties well and is willing to attack the deep middle. Comes in with a pre­-snap plan. Throws catchable ball with good touch. Able to play pitch and catch when he's in rhythm. Can drop a deep ball in the bucket with good air under it. Works through progressions and isn't a ""Checkdown Charlie."" Hits receivers in stride on vertical throws.",Lacking NFL-­caliber arm strength. Doesn't have enough zip to challenge cornerbacks on field side throws. Will have to learn to live off of timing throws to compensate for lack of velocity. Can be rattled in the pocket and will throw without feet being set rather than sliding around in the pocket. LSU game got too big for him. Appeared to lose confidence and began rushing throws and footwork fell apart. Doesn't have athleticism to escape the rush or make plays with his legs.,Backup
2015,Jameis Winston,"Winston is a big, highly competitive pocket passer who played in a pro-style offense and showed an ability to anticipate throwing windows, scan the entire field and make the NFL throws. His wind-up delivery and marginal mobility outside the pocket are reminiscent of Byron Leftwich, but his arm talent and issues with decision making are more in line with Eli Manning's. Winston's football potential is clearer than so-called ""system"" or ""one-read"" quarterbacks, but every stone must be overturned in an attempt to piece together a predictive character profile on Winston. Winston's supreme confidence might be considered arrogance by some, but even that trait will be alluring to teams who need to find a franchise quarterback.","Considered by scouting community to be advanced in ability to scan field and get through progressions. Has natural feel for throwing windows and anticipates openings that other college quarterbacks don't see. Has height to see over offensive line and thickness of build to withstand NFL hits. Big arm by NFL standards. Gets full extension and follow through into throws with ability to drive ball into the seam in front of safeties. Can make all of the field-side throws teams need. Most teammates very trusting and protective of him, according to regional scouts. Aware in pocket, but not overly jittery. Good feel for edge pressure and steps up into pocket while continuing his scan. When pressure mounts, so does his focus. Shows faith in his wide receivers and willing to go right back to them after a drop. Strong lower body and able to shake free of some would-be sacks and get rid of the ball. Fierce competitor and unafraid of mistakes. Shows above-average football character. Will make throws and take chances others won't, which can be a special trait if properly harnessed.","Decision making not consistent with his football intelligence. Will throw into impossible windows rather than taking safe throw underneath. Elongated windup and release allows instinctive defenders to close on throws. Was too easily baited into dangerous throws. Struggled with intermediate passing game in 2014, completing 56.8 percent of his passes with FBS-leading 11 interceptions in that range. Still learning nuances of position and how to move and hold defenders with his eyes. Would sleepwalk through first half of many games. Inconsistent footwork and weight transfer caused balls to sail. Prone to emotional outbursts on field. Quality of decision-making drops off substantially when pocket becomes turbulent and he's forced to leave it. Lacks athleticism to extend plays for very long outside of the pocket.

2015,Marcus Mariota,"Scheme-based quarterback who will face the same challenges that several quarterbacks before him have faced in terms of learning how to read defenses and go through progressions. The tape was less kind to Mariota than expected, but his size, athleticism and consistency of football character throughout his career are necessary traits in becoming a good-to-great quarterback. Mariota's ability to create outside the pocket will help win games here and there and buy him time as he plies his craft. However, to reach his potential and match the play with the traits, he must develop more poise and feel in the pocket and improve his field vision. Mariota is no lock to be a great NFL quarterback, but his floor is much higher than any of the quarterbacks drafted in 2014.","Quick-twitch quarterback. Rare straight-line speed for the position. Defenses must account for ability outside the pocket. Asked to handle more each season by Ducks coaches and delivered consistent production.

Threw multiple interceptions in a game just three times over 41 career starts. Adequate accuracy and ball placement from the pocket. Able to make off-balance, difficult throws. Can uncork throws quickly and without resetting feet when necessary. Can climb the pocket and deliver strikes when he trusts the edges of his protection. Silky smooth when asked to roll out and delivers on time with sound mechanics. Has balance and feet to escape collapsing pocket and will look to strike through the air rather than just bolting as a runner. Size, speed and enough skill to eat in the red zone. Considered extremely coachable by scouts, who also love his willingness to play hurt. Very humble and leads by example. Family and heritage are extremely important to him.","Benefits from an offense that is predicated on simplified reads. Offense able to create wide-open receivers after busted coverages at times. Needs to improve resetting feet when maneuvering pocket to improve accuracy and power. Tends to ""see"" pass rush too often. Will drop eyes and look to escape pocket rather than stepping to available pocket space. Frequent trips outside pocket increase opportunity for injury. Pocket feel is very average. Stepped into sacks he had no business taking. Didn't have to throw to tight windows often. Average processor on field. Still learning when to get rid of the ball and move to next play. Slow to make anticipatory throws and can improve patience in allowing combo routes to mature rather than rushing the read. Missed obvious pre-snap blitzes. Drive accuracy needs work. When cutting it loose, ball tends to sail on him a bit. Arm strength is adequate but inconsistent to field side. Needs to bring hips through throws to increase zip into tight windows in NFL. Fumbled 27 times during his career.",Low End Starter
2015,Garrett Grayson,"Grayson went from fringe draft prospect to clearly on the draft board with a strong 2014 season. Despite average arm talent, he uses good lower-body mechanics to generate velocity and his touch and accuracy on deep throws is eye-opening. Grayson needs more tape work to help improve his decision-making, but his size, production and growth at the position have ticked the requisite draft boxes to make him an intriguing mid-round prospect.","Tremendous deep-ball touch and accuracy this season. Puts air under the ball and feathers throw into consistently catchable spots for receivers. Gets feet set and uses lower body and proper weight transfer to drive the ball to his target with zip. Works to square shoulders to throw when outside of the pocket. Scouts love his toughness and improved poise in the pocket. Willing to face down oncoming rusher and take hit in order to deliver the pass. Shows confidence to challenge safeties and will attack press-man cornerbacks over the top. Production improved each season as starter. Has worked under center, in pistol and out of shotgun.","Has a small windup, which slows release. Catch-and-run touchdowns helped inflate his YPA and touchdowns this season. Tape work shows inconsistent decision-making and and a need for faster processing. Gets too locked in on his primary target. Rarely threatens defenses with feet. Lacks improvisation and ability to extend plays. Needs play to stay on schedule. Needs work on anticipation and trusting windows. Slow getting into his drops and scouts want quicker ball handling from him. Shows inconsistent accuracy on short throws into windows against zone.",Backup
2015,Sean Mannion,"Tall, rhythm thrower who shows an ability to play with confidence and accuracy when used as a game manager within an offense featuring a strong rushing attack. Mannion needs plays to stay on schedule or his confidence becomes shaky and the turnovers start rolling in.

Tall quarterback who sees over the offensive line. Throws with high release point. Plays with desired footwork. Can sit down and shift weight properly to drive the intermediate throws. Played in pro-style offense and is comfortable with 3-, 5- and 7-step drops from under center. When protected, shows confidence to stand and deliver with accuracy to all areas of the field. Trusted by head coach Mike Riley to make pre-snap reads and audible. Played in multiple-read offense and shows patience in allowing routes to develop. Good feel for pro-style play-action passing attack and can throw with above-average accuracy and ball placement.","Tempo of his play is a concern. Slow in takeaway from center, setup and getting through progressions. Carries ball low in the pocket, allowing defenders to swipe at it. Finished career with 30 fumbles and 54 interceptions. Poise and mobility in pocket are below average. Not considered a play-extender outside of pocket. Drops eyes and misses throwing windows when he senses pressure around him. Decision making greatly influenced by level of pressure around him. Fails to throw with adequate zip when feet aren't under him and he doesn't step strongly into throw.",Backup
2015,Bryce Petty,"NFL evaluators felt like Petty's senior season was disappointing, but those same evaluators love his size, leadership and intangibles. He needs a year or two of practice time and camp work to learn how to get through his progressions, but has the intelligence to do that. Petty must have a structured offense that won't ask him to make plays outside of the pocket.","Possesses NFL size. Not a burner, but has enough functional movement outside of the pocket. Scouts label him ultra-competitive, tough and smart. Strong leader. Engineered 21-point fourth-quarter comeback win over TCU in 2014. Played through a back injury for most of his senior season. Doesn't have a cannon, but arm strength is NFL-starter quality. Deep-ball accuracy improved from 2013 to 2014. Understands when to throw the fastball and when to use touch. Gets feet set with good balance on delivery. Keeps ball at proper height on setup and has quick release.

Has tendency to spray the ball against zone coverage on intermediate routes. Can extend plays but won't make many plays downfield once he extends. Mistakes happen when forced to come off of first read. Struggles when defenders are near his feet. Yards per attempt declined in 2014 and screens were a much higher percentage of his passes. Struggles to pull himself from the doldrums when having a poor game. Nose of the ball dives when he doesn't drive throws with his lower body. Must learn to read defenses and get through his progressions when he joins the NFL.,Backup
2015,Brett Hundley,"Hundley flashes athleticism and talent, but his basic quarterbacking issues will take time to improve. In 2014, more than 54 percent of his pass attempts were from six yards and in, including 29 percent from behind the line of scrimmage, which is nothing like an NFL offense. Hundley is a ""flash"" prospect who shows the physical tools to be a starter, but his internal clock and issues with reads and progressions must be improved to give him a shot at becoming a decent NFL starter.",Well-built with frame sturdy enough to handle rigors of the position.

Has adequate release and enough arm when he sits down on his throws. Above-average foot quickness to escape pocket. Hit 57-yard playaction touchdown from under center against Washington in 2014 (just seven attempts under center all year). Good sense of pocket pressure and is decisive when he decides to bolt. Dangerous as a runner with enough speed to hit a big play on the ground. Dual-threat ability increases his effectiveness in red zone. Displays his toughness almost every time out.,Well-built with frame sturdy enough to handle rigors of the position. Asked to get through progressions and make decisions. Willing to stand in and take the hit when he zeroes in on his target. Willing to get take downfield shot and give his receiver a chance to make the play. Has the ability to maneuver inside of pocket to buy time. Poised enough from pocket. Has adequate release and enough arm when he sits down on his throws. Above-average foot quickness to escape pocket. Hit 57-yard playaction touchdown from under center against Washington in 2014 (just seven attempts under center all year).

Dual-threat ability increases his effectiveness in red zone. Displays his toughness almost every time out.,Backup
2014,Blake Bortles,"Big, athletic, ascending quarterback with enough arm talent and intangibles to develop into a franchise starter. Is not yet a finished product and scouts' opinions vary on his ceiling, but elements of Bortles’ skill set compare to some of the best in the game today, and his best football is ahead of him.","Outstanding size, stature, bulk and athletic ability for the position. Stands tall in the pocket and delivers the ball in the face of heavy pressure. Keeps his eyes downfield while climbing the pocket. Good field vision and release point. Is efficient throwing on the run and excels on bootlegs and play-action passing. Good zip and accuracy on short-to-intermediate throws -- can fit the ball into tight windows. Nice touch to drop throws in the bucket -- delivers a catchable ball with fine anticipation. Senses pressure and evades the rush. Doesn’t take many unnecessary sacks. Can extend plays with his feet or tuck it and dash for the sticks when the pocket breaks. Surprising foot speed. Plays with confidence and poise. Engineered comeback victories, beat Penn State and Louisville on the road and took a mid-major program to a BCS bowl.",Could stand to hasten his setup and polish his footwork (deteriorates under duress). Could stand to shorten his release -- wraps the ball slightly at the beginning of his windup. Too much effort in his delivery to generate slightly above-average arm strength. Operated in an offense where he made a lot of one-look reads. Does not spin spirals consistently -- too many throws come out with loose wobble (could struggle to cut the wind in blustery conditions). Ordinary deep-ball thrower. Tends to throw off his back foot when pressured (affects accuracy). Works heavily out of the gun -- will have to adapt to snaps under center and deep drops. Operates a dink-and-dunk offense which inflates his completion percentage. Fumbled nine times as a junior and could improve ball handling/security. Play dropped off against Ohio State in 2012 and South Carolina in '13 and wiill require time to adjust to the closing speed of NFL defensive backs. Is just a two-year starter and can improve his understanding of the game.,Low End Starter
2014,Johnny Manziel,"A very unique, run-around, ad-lib, sandlot-style quarterback who consistently won games playing a brand of fast-paced, jailbreak football that often goes off script and can be difficult both to game plan with and against. Is most comfortable on the move outside the pocket where he can find open throwing lanes and see the field and will command mush rush and extra spy defenders. Has defied the odds and proven to be a great college-system quarterback, but still must prove he is willing to work to be great, adjust his hard-partying, Hollywood lifestyle and be able to inspire his teammates by more than his playmaking ability. Overall character, leadership ability and work habits will define his NFL career. Rare competitiveness and third-down efficiency could carry him a long way, yet he will be challenged to avoid a Ryan Leaf-like, crash-and-burn scenario if he does not settle down and mature. A high-risk, high-reward pick, Manziel stands to benefit from entering the NFL at a time when moving pockets are trending.","Has very big hands and grips the ball well on the move. Dynamic athlete. Exceptional game-day competitor -- rises to the occasion. Has a passion for the game. Played on the biggest of stages and revels in having his back against the wall. Stepped up against a national-championship Alabama defense in 2012 and has proven he can command come-from-behind victories, as he capped his career in the Chick-fil-A bowl vs. Duke by overcoming a 21-point halftime deficit. Sufficient timing, ball placement and accuracy (68.9 percent career passing percentage). Terrific scrambling ability. Reverse spins and buys time in the pocket while continuing to scan the field -- can still set his feet, alter his throwing motion and manipulate his arm and throwing platform. Houdini-like escapability (uses subtle, nifty sidestep moves) and improvisional ability in the pocket to pull a rabbit out of his hat and create magic. Has peripheral, wide-eyed running vision (sometimes seems like he has eyes in back of his head) and a very good feel for spacing. Carries the ball with a fearless confidence that he will find a way to create and usually gains positive yardage on broken plays when he appears trapped. Is mentally and physically tough -- will pop back up from hard collisions and respond to a challenge. Record-setting and award-winning two-year production. Has a knack for sustaining drives and possesses playmaking ability to create on third downs and in critical situations to keep the sticks moving.","Has an unorthodox body type with marginal height, rounded shoulders, an underdeveloped body and very big feet that almost look clumsy. Will need to learn to do a better job protecting his body and sliding. Feels pocket ghosts and often takes off running at the second flash of coverage. Undisciplined -- plays his own offense and presses to make plays. Cannot see over the pocket easily and almost never steps up into it, creating extra difficulties for OL coaches to coordinate blocking schemes and for offensive linemen to anticipate where the pocket will be. Dances around the pocket too much and creates needless sacks rolling into protection when the pocket is clean. Has not worked from under center, and footwork and set-up will require refinement. Often throws the ball up in the air and relies on big receivers to adjust to it and make plays, highly benefiting from the playmaking ability of Mike Evans. Tends to overshoot the deep ball and throw off his back foot, leading to some underthrows (too many dirtballs on the move) and diminished accuracy. Needlessly pats the ball when he scans the field. Could stand to do a better job carrying out play-action fakes. Has not developed a reputation as a worker or for doing the extras. Suspect intangibles -- not a leader by example or known to inspire by his words. Carries a sense of entitlement and prima-donna arrogance seeking out the bright lights of Hollywood. Is known to party too much and is drawn to all the trappings of the game. Lacks ideal starting experience (only two years), operated a non-traditional offense and has a lot to learn.",Backup
2014,Teddy Bridgewater,"A calculated, football-smart, precision-matchup rhythm passer, Bridgewater would be best suited entering a warm-weather or dome environment such as those most common in the South divisions. Would stand to benefit heavily from operating a short, dink-and-dunk rhythm passing game. Compensates for a lack of elite arm talent and prototype measureables with the intangibles and football intelligence that could elevate the other 52 players around him. Instinctive passer with the laser-beam determination to become a Pro Bowl-caliber passer in the right system.","Extremely competitive and driven to succeed. Well-prepared and confident in his approach. Operated a pro-style, progression-read offense where he is asked to scan the whole field and set protections. Footwork is very clean and in rhythm -- throws on balance with sound mechanics, a fluid delivery and smooth stroke. Very good timing, touch and anticipation -- throws receivers open. Is patient working through his reads and will step up in the pocket. Sells play-action hard and takes what the defense gives him. Poised in the face of the blitz and often anticipates it coming. Is very mentally and physically tough -- played through a broken left wrist with a sprained ankle in what was essentially the 2012 Big East championship game, coming off the bench to captain the Cardinals to a come-from-behind victory. Is a student of the game with a very good understanding of football concepts. Plays like a coach on the field, knows the responsibilities of everyone on the field and can get teammates lined up correctly. Makes few mental errors. Consistently moves the chains and converts in critical situations. Is given a lot of autonomy to make pre-snap reads and adjustments at the line of scrimmage and understands how to exploit defenses. Meticulous in his preparation. Has a passion for the game and really works at it. Smart, determined and focused. Is only 21 years old -- incredibly mature for his age and can see the big picture. Really works at his craft and showed gradual improvement every season. Football is extremely important to him. Highly respected, unselfish team leader.","Has a very lean, narrow frame with limited bulk and small hands. Does not drive the ball with velocity down the field and can be affected by cold and windy conditions (see Cincinnati). Can improve placement and touch on the deep ball. Adequate athlete. Is not an overly elusive scrambler -- struggles escaping the rush and buying a second chance with his feet vs. pressure. Passing stats are padded from operating a passing game that relies heavily on short, lateral tosses. Long-term durability could become a concern without continued strength and weight gains.",Low End Starter
2014,Derek Carr,"Athletic, tough, instinctive, strong-armed, highly competitive quarterback who will impress in workouts, interviews and on the board. Elevated the Fresno State program and profiles like a gunslinger, though he’d be better served in the long run honing his game-management skills. Will be a starter sooner rather than later and the degree to which he’s able to make those around him better will determine his ceiling.","Athletic with very good feet -- can roll the pocket, evade the rush or escape when pocket crumbles. Terrific arm talent -- releases from the ear and can make all the throws. Quick-armed with wrist snap. Can alter his platform and throw on the move or off his back foot. Throws come out on time and accurately. Drills short-to-intermediate throws and flashes touch. Likes to play and it shows. Sells out to make a play. Record-breaking production. Adapted to coaching/system change and receiver turnover. Improved ball security -- fumbled only once as a senior compared to 12 times the previous two seasons. Desirable intangibles for the position -- advanced maturity, leadership and intelligence. Shows poise and moxie. On-field general who commands the huddle. Passionate about the game and works at his craft. Three-time captain.",Lacks ideal height and has relatively small hands. Bulk is just adequate. Could stand to improve as a deep passer. At times tries to do too much and forces some throws. Occasionally throws off balance unnecessarily and sails some throws. Operated out of the shotgun and pistol and made a lot short/lateral throws and half-field reads. Production is inflated by spread offense and porous Mountain West Conference defenses -- nine 2013 opponents (excluding an FCS opponent) ranked between 81st and 125th nationally in scoring defense and/or passing defense. Had his worst game in the Las Vegas Bowl against USC. Could face bust-factor perception resulting from his older brother’s career.,High End Starter
2014,Jimmy Garoppolo,"A decorated, FCS passer, Garoppolo could excite quarterback coaches with his quick delivery, mental make-up and work habits, yet he still needs to prove he can fit the ball into tight windows and do more than carve up soft shells the way he regularly did on his way to a record-breaking performance in college. Possesses the physical tools to eventually earn an NFL starting job in a rhythm passing game with continued refinement, but is more of a caretaker than a game changer and will require some patience adapting to the NFL game.","Has a very quick trigger and good wrist snap that translates to a smooth throwing motion and clean, compact delivery (no windup). Lightning release quickness. Urgent decision maker. Sells play-action. Athletic enough to slide in the pocket and buy time with his feet while keeping his eyes downfield. Good anticipation -- throws his receivers open. Can change ball speeds and drop it in a bucket. Does not take unnecessary sacks and will dump the ball. Will deliver the ball looking down the barrell of a gun. Tough-minded and poised in the pocket -- can withstand a hit and pop back up. Highly competitive. Smart, respected, vocal team leader. Very durable, experienced, four-year starter. Good football intelligence.","Is a tad undersized with small hands and short arms. Uses a three-quarters delivery that could lead to batted balls. Works heavily out of the shotgun in a spread offense and footwork could require adjustment to working from under center. Does not always feel pressure in the pocket. Does not rip the deep out or drive the ball with high RPMs. Undershoots and often hangs the deep ball. Makes receivers work for the ball downfield and deep accuracy could stand to improve. Makes a lot of simple, one-look reads and was not heavily challenged by consistent pressure or complex looks in the Ohio Valley Conference.",Low End Starter
2014,Logan Thomas,"Unrefined, strong-armed, sturdy pocket passer who looks the part and has intriguing, raw arm talent, though he is a converted tight end whose inexperience showed throughout a yo-yo career in Blacksburg. Has definite developmental value given his starter-caliber skill set and intangible makeup. Would benefit from coaching continuity, more specifically a QB coach capable of refining his crude talent.","Outstanding size, stature and strength -- towers over the line, has natural throwing lanes from the pocket and is able to make plays in the grasp. Athletic -- can climb the pocket, escape and run for the sticks. Load to bring down. Generates easy velocity with a quick, compact release and can make all the throws. Is very competitive and will sell out to make a play. Has upside. Tough and durable -- started 40 consecutive games. Team captain and vocal leader.","Plateaued as a sophomore. Uneven performance. Inconsistent footwork and mechanics. Shoddy ball placement. Still developing touch and deep-ball accuracy. Needs to quicken his eyes and expand his field vision. Needs to learn to protect himself -- is not elusive and represents a big target to defenders. Struggled in big games, including a nightmare performance against Alabama. Too careless with the football -- 39 INTs and 23 fumbles as a starter. Career 50-percent passer on third down.",Backup
2014,Tom Savage,"Big, inconsistent pocket passer who took a circuitous route to Pittsburgh, where he played a full season for the first time since 2009. Is inconsistent and in need of more reps, but has ample arm talent to warrant developmental consideration if teams deem his intangibles worthy of an investment.","Terrific size. Sets with balance. Easy, compact, high three-quarters release. Spins a catchable ball. Excellent arm strength to complete NFL throws -- capable of sticking outs from the deep hash or launching balls 60 yards on the money. Experience in pro-style offense. Smart and hardworking. Solid personal and football character. Has tools to work with. Team captain.","Needs to speed up his clock and show better awareness in the pocket. Needs to quicken his eyes, expand his field vision and learn to manipulate safeties. Tends to stare down his target. Forces some throws into traffic. Erratic accuracy. Slow of foot -- not a scramble threat. Can improve play-action fake. Had some duds -- struggled against Florida State, Virginia and Virginia Tech. Mental toughness needs to be looked into.",Backup
2014,Aaron Murray,"Diminutive, game-managing pocket passer still recovering from a torn ACL. Would benefit from a moving pocket that can create open throwing lanes, yet does not have the foot quickness desired for a rollout passing game. Possesses a skill set most ideally suited for a backup or No. 3 role. Intelligence, intangibles and experience are all pluses.","Has a quick release and is light enough on his feet to escape the first wave and make some plays on the move. Solid decision-maker -- takes what the defense gives him. Fine short-to-intermediate accuracy. Good intangibles. Encouraging team leader with a likeable personality. Leads by example. Serves well as the face of the program. Outstanding work ethic. Is very intelligent and football smart. Experienced, four-year starter in the SEC.",Short and short-armed with a low release point that leads to batted balls. Very small-framed with a thin waist and a body that is not built to withstand the punishment that comes in the pocket. Average arm talent. Has to set his feet and everything needs to be perfect to function well. Could stand to improve his footwork. Marginal deep-ball accuracy -- tends to overstride and forces receivers to adjust. Many passes are pre-determined and often throws to spots. Loses poise under duress and can be rattled easily by pressure. Gets too jittery and anxious (overanalyzes) in big games and has a very low winning percentage vs. top-10 teams. Long-term durability is concerning.,Backup
2014,AJ McCarron,"An efficient game-managing quarterback who has shown he can carry an offense at times throughout his career, but more often is dependent on a terrific supporting cast. Grades out most highly for his intangibles and decision-making, knowing when and where to go with the ball, and could earn an NFL starting job.","Well-versed operating a pro-style offense and makes NFL-style progression reads. Is comfortable working from under center and in the gun. Mobile enough to sidestep the first wave. Good field vision, timing and anticipation. Very good short-to-intermediate accuracy (evidenced by a 66.9 percent career completion rate). Throws with accuracy on the move -- good wrist snap. Delivers the ball under duress. Has enough arm strength to fit the ball into spots. Consistent throwing mechanics -- has a smooth stroke. Good caretaker and decision-maker. Mature leader. Smart and articulate. Highly competitive team leader -- holds teammates accountable. Very well-prepared. Directed back-to-back national championship offenses.","Surrounded by an NFL-caliber supporting cast with a very good offensive line that provides a lot of time to dissect the field. Does not have a big-time, vertical arm. Average athlete. Makes occasional bone-headed decisions. Heaves the deep ball and forces receivers to make adjustments. Does not drive the deep out.",Low End Starter
2014,Zach Mettenberger,"Pure dropback, strong-armed thrower who will require patient, confidence-building play-calling and a clean pocket to function at a high level in the NFL. Has starter talent in a vertical, downfield passing attack if he can learn to take command of a huddle and continue progressing as a decision-maker. How he interviews with teams could go a long way toward determining his draft status.",Exceptional size. Outstanding arm strength -- spins it with velocity and can make all the throws. Can drill the deep out and fit it into a tight window across the field throwing to his left. Ran an NFL-style offense under coordinator Cam Cameron and learned how to become more of a leader as a senior.,"Heavy-footed with a long delivery, which translates to the pocket closing on him quickly when he moves and is forced off a spot. Takes unnecessary sacks and is rattled easily under duress. Really labors to hasten his release and get rid of the ball quickly when needed. Has tunnel vision and arms the ball too much. Tends to trigger late and frequently underthrows the deep ball. Does not throw receivers open and forces them to adjust. Can learn to take pace off the ball and throw with more touch, better timing and anticipation. Had a very strong supporting cast with NFL-caliber receivers and a stout offensive line. Weight fluctuated early in his career and arrived at LSU pushing 260 pounds. Is coming off an ACL injury and will require some rehabilitation time. Character will require closer scrutiny.",Backup
2014,David Fales,"Burst onto the scene as a junior-college transfer in 2012 when he led the nation in completion percentage (72.5), executing a quarterback-friendly system and putting himself on the NFL radar. Concerns about his height and arm strength will limit his appeal, but at worst should be a quality backup in a precision-matchup system.","Well built (works hard in the weight room). Sets up cleanly and with balance. Nice play fake. Compact, three-quarters release with clean, quick arm action. Throws a clean spiral with good short-to-intermediate accuracy. Flashes touch. Confident and competitive. Tough and durable. Sparkling intangibles -- outstanding personal and football character. Leads vocally and by example and is universally respected. Intelligent, passionate, motivated football junkie who takes pride in his craft and puts the time in to improve.",Lacks ideal height and has relatively small hands. Average foot athlete and escapability. Can improve maneuverability in the pocket. Not yet sophisticated with his eyes. Tends to stare down his primary. Arm strength is just functional -- struggles to drill velocity throws on a line and is not a natural deep thrower. Accuracy wanes downfield. Needs to improve against the blitz. Just a two-year starter.,Backup
2014,Keith Wenning,"Heavy-bodied, dink-and-dunk, rhythm passer who could be challenged to fit the ball into tight NFL windows. Has the makeup desired in a No. 3 QB and could develop into a functional backup in a West Coast passing game.","Experienced, four-year starter with a solid build. Very smart and understands the offense. Outstanding football character and personal character -- works at his craft, is driven to succeed and will represent a franchise well. Respected leader -- two-time team captain. Football is very improtant to him. Very tough and highly competitive. Has directed 10 fourth-quarter comebacks in his career. Consistent in his approach.","Average arm strength, athletic ability and pocket mobility to avoid the first wave and make throws off-balance and under duress. Carries a heavyness in his body and lacks twitch. Works almost exclusively out of the gun and will need to adapt to working from under center. Cannot easily manipulate his arm and throwing platform. Does not drive the deep out and accuracy and placement diminishes downfield. Production is inflated from regularly facing inferior MAC competition.",Backup
2014,Tajh Boyd,"Difficult to prepare for and difficult to block, Boyd is a short, athletic, strong-armed quarterback with Wildcat value and starter potential in a vertical-power system, though he is the type you look to replace. The success of Russell Wilson likely helps Boyd’s cause, but he is not as polished and might be better suited as a backup.","Sets quickly. Can sling it when he’s in rhythm and has a clean pocket. Good zip short-to-intermediate. Can launch deep throws 60-plus yards and flashes touch to drop it in the bucket. Shows composure in the face of a blitz and is willing to take a hit to make a play. Makes plays with his feet, be it rolling the pocket, extending plays or throwing on the move (left or right). Slippery and elusive to escape the rush and is a threat to tuck and dash for the sticks. Good straight-line speed and run strength for a quarterback (will lower his shoulder on defenders). Team captain and three-year starter. Terrific football character. Is universally liked and will be a godsend for the P.R. staff.","Does not look the part -- lacks ideal height and weight tends to fluctuate (nicknamed “Fat Boy” by teammates). Throws with a low elbow and sails downfield throws -- can improve his accuracy. Inconsistent decision-making. Did not take snaps under center in a pistol, read-option offense and production was inflated by NFL-caliber skill players. Will require patience adapting to pro-style passing. Needs to quicken his eyes and expand his field vision. Does not always see the overhanging safety or short-hole defender. Tends to read first and second options before fleeing the pocket. Durability could be a concern given his style -- needs to learn to slide.",Backup
2014,Garrett Gilbert,"A highly-touted prep recruit who struggled to secure a starting job at Texas after cycling through three offenses in three years. Graduated early and transferred to SMU, where he settled down in a simplified system under the guidance of June Jones. Could fend for a job in a West Coast offense.","Outstanding size. Very good timing, touch and short accuracy. Can buy time in the pocket with his feet. Has NFL pedigree -- father played more than a decade in the league. Very strong pro day showing, completing 87-of-88 passes and throwing well against air.","Operated a dink-and-dunk passing game featuring a lot of high-percentage, lateral tosses and short crossers that heavily padded his completion percentage. Does not drive the ball on deep outs or possess a high-velocity arm to rip the ball through high winds. Has a low release point that leads to a lot of batted balls. Is not an elusive scrambler and eyes drop under duress.",Backup
2013,EJ Manuel,"As gifted as any quarterback in the class, the physically imposing Manuel has a chance to shoot up this list using his strong arm and mobility in 2012. Scouts appreciate his leadership qualities and toughness (played through his mom's cancer treatments and a broken leg in 2011’s Champs Sports Bowl win over Notre Dame), and hope he can improve on his consistency. The Seminoles' decision-making and accuracy drop in the face of pressure, but Manuel has the velocity and mobility teams look for in a project quarterback.","Physically imposing passer. Throws from the shotgun formation quite often, but is also effective on play action. Flashes the velocity to stretch the field and throw in tight spaces between defenders and on the sideline. Displays good touch on throws to each level of the field, finds receivers between defenders and drop passes over their head. Good athlete with the mobility to step up in the pocket to avoid pressure and take advantage of openings to pick up first downs with his feet. Quick release, though it often looks as though he’s throwing darts on shorter throws. Intelligent, high character team leader.","Gives opponents too many chances for turnovers by forcing throws into coverage trying to make a play. Area code accuracy – short throws are often low or wide, preventing receivers from making a play after the catch. Deep ball accuracy is uneven, as well. Gets happy feet under pressure, spins to the outside to avoid the rush. Inconsistent recognizing blitz. Must step into his throws more consistently to fully utilize his arm strength.",Backup
2013,Geno Smith,"Though Smith has had his ups and downs as a passer in West Virginia's prolific spread offense, NFL general managers appreciate his ultra-competitive nature, athleticism, arm strength and quick delivery. The Mountaineer turned down a Senior Bowl invitation after regressing in the second half of the season following a strong start. Smith's eye level and pocket movement can be great, but he reverted back to staring down his first read. During his sophomore season, Smith played in an offense where he frequently took snaps from center, so he might have a leg up compared to some other prospects in that regard.","Competitive, confident player who can lead a team with his physical attributes and willingness to work on his craft. Possesses a quick delivery, can get the ball downfield or move a team methodically by making quick decisions. Has improved his accuracy greatly during his career, placing the ball very well at every level of the field. Fires throws into tight windows over the middle while also leading receivers open on the sideline and showing touch on fades into the end zone. Generally keeps his eyes downfield and feet moving within the pocket to find a target instead of looking to run. Finds second or third options across the field if first read is covered. Tests defenses with his ability to get first downs and more with his feet, has speed to break off big runs and usually makes the right decision on when to take off. Has gotten physically stronger over the course of his career, is a tough player who will hang onto the ball after a big hit and bounce back up.","Runs a spread offense almost exclusively from the shotgun, needs work on his footwork coming from under center. Ball will float or sail if his feet are not set or he fails to transfer weight, either in the pocket when facing pressure or when throwing on the run. Blitz awareness is only adequate, will miss guys coming free to his left and right. Will back up from pressure at times instead of unloading the ball or stepping up to make the throw. Seemingly regressed each week, especially when locking on to one side of the field. Did not participate in the Senior Bowl.",High End Starter
2013,Mike Glennon,"The lean, strong-armed passer performed fairly well in a difficult situation (3,054 yards, 31 touchdowns) when asked to take over for Wolfpack legend Russell Wilson in 2011. If he improves his accuracy and pocket poise in his second season as a starter, as well as his ability to recognize what defenses are trying to takes away from him, scouts just might project him as an eventual starter.","Progress as a passer began to show in the final three games of the year, connecting on 65 percent of his throws for 274 yards a game, 11 touchdowns and just two picks in wins over Clemson, Maryland and Louisville in the Belk Bowl. Uses his height to see receivers running open in the short and medium ranges, making accurate throws to lead them into open areas after the catch. His long legs don’t prevent him from running a pro-style attack, as he seems able to work from under center and run bootlegs. Arm strength is certainly sufficient to distribute the ball all over the field, and he can place it between defenders over the middle when his target sits down in zones.","His average foot quickness will cause him issues trying to avoid defenders in a collapsing pocket. Tends to retreat instead of stepping up to deliver in the face of pressure -- though his arm gives him a chance to get the ball out of bounds or find an open target while still backpedalling. And while he has the arm and tight spiral to threaten defenses with the deep ball, his inconsistent accuracy and reading of coverages keep him from being efficient in the vertical game.",Low End Starter
2013,Matt Barkley,"Expect Barkley to be the fourth first-round passer Southern California has produced since 2003 (Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart, Mark Sanchez). Though not elite in terms of his height, arm strength, or mobility, he will capably move an NFL offense with accurate short throws possessing sufficient zip (69.1 percent completion rate in 2011), solid decision-making ability, and enough downfield touch to take advantage of a talented receiving corps. Although it ended disappointingly, the fact he decided to return to school for 2012 to help his team compete for a national championship after being on a postseason ban is just one measure of his intangibles.","Experienced running a pro-style system. Makes adjustments at the line of scrimmage (including the run game) and unloads the ball quickly when seeing a favorable matchup before the snap. Usually accurate when he is able to set his base and stride into his throws. Offense was designed to move the pocket to account for his height, and, while he isn’t overly athletic, he showed the mobility to throw accurately on bootlegs and half rolls. Looks off and pump-fake safeties and communicate with receivers pre-snap on the opposite side of the field from which he intends to throw. Three-time team captain also possesses intangibles NFL teams desire at the position, taking hits and bouncing back, displaying intelligence with his multiple academic all-conference accolades, and earning a spot on the 2011 Allstate AFCA Good Works team.","Lacks ideal height for the position. Does not have a plus arm, though it’s enough to run a movement-based NFL offense. Allows defenders into plays when he is unable to step into throws, especially when going across the field. Inconsistent making throws against pressure. Does have have physical tools to make throws when he's not set, but has progressed in his ability to find space and get the ball of with awkward release platforms. Ball comes out of his hand poorly at times, though it usually reaches its intended target. Confident enough in his pre-snap read that he’ll stare down his initial target. Sails passes over his receivers’ heads when feeling pressure or in the three-step game. No threat to pick up large chunks of yardage with his feet. Improved completion percentage in 2011 came partially due to quick east-west throws to his talented wideouts. While he had a lot of attempts, there are questions as to what degree structure of the offense featured him or masked his physical limitations. Other than a hot stretch over the second half of his junior season, his production has been almost entirely tied to the strength of his surrounding cast.",Backup
2013,Ryan Nassib,"Nassib doesn’t have exceptional size or athleticism, but the muscle bound thrower has a rifle for an arm and was finally comfortable in the Syracuse offense in 2012, even though his happy feet might suggest differently. The senior might have a tendency to sail targets and force some poor reads, but multiple teams will likely consider adding Nassib as an early starter, not just a backup or developmental prospect as many suspected prior to this season.","Thick-bodied arm talent who can distribute the ball at every level. Plus velocity when balanced and clean in his footwork. Strong, quick release, gets the ball out in a hurry on hitches and slants. Accurate to all parts of the field when in rhythm. Comes off initial read, can look off safety to come to the opposite side of the field. Willing to shovel the ball or make a last-ditch throw to make a play instead of taking a sack. Displays the ability to step up within the pocket or move to either side to create space to throw. Flashes air, touch, and accuracy on fades in the end zone. Puts a lot of air under deep balls, giving his man a chance to make a play. Sells play action and screens well. Places the ball on the run, especially to his right. Competitive player who directs his teammates well and does not give up on any game. Tough enough to take big hits, bull for a first down with his feet.","Possesses only average height for the position. Gunslinger mentality causes him to trust his arm and receivers too much, resulting in bad decisions/turnovers. Not in elite in his mobility or elusiveness outside the pocket, won’t run away from NFL defenders. Footwork is inconsistent, gets happy and actually hops around when trying to find a target. Must be more consistent transferring weight through the throw, relies on his strong arm at times and comes up short on outs or sails throws over the middle. Works nearly exclusively out of the shotgun, but has athleticism to handle plays under center.",Backup
2013,Tyler Wilson,"After he looked like a superstar in the making after his 2011 campaign, Wilson was unable to improve upon his junior season for a myriad of reasons, including the loss of his head coach, the departure of his three favorite receivers, and a sub-par offensive line. Wilson spent much of the year under duress, but showed impressive toughness in consistently staring down the barrel to deliver throws while getting hit, and bouncing up right after. While scouts will want to see more from Wilson in the vertical passing game, it’s tough to ignore his overall skill set. In addition to these quarterbacking skills, Wilson’s a proven leader and it has been reported that he comes off as quite charming in interviews with teams. When these facts are combined with the number of quarterback-needy teams in the draft, it’s very likely that Wilson will ultimately be a top-15 pick.","Good size and overall strength for a pocket passer. Tough player who bounces up after hits. Steps up into the pocket and stands tall to deliver the ball under duress -– which is just part of outstanding leadership qualities. Arm strength is very impressive in the intermediate game. Shows ability to hit stationery targets and the anticipation to lead receivers in stride and wait patiently for them to get open. Looks at multiple targets before checking down to underneath option. Quicker feet than anticipated, can get first downs on the run when defenses are in man or in deep zones. Can sling the ball into the flat from awkward release points.","Delivery a bit longer than scouts like, his windup allows some alert defensive backs into plays downfield. While he has impressive intermediate arm strength, Wilson frequently floats or underthrows balls on deeper patterns due to a tendency to drop his elbow. Not a quick-twitch athlete; footwork coming out from under center is uneven, pro pass rushers will get him on first contact and disciplined linebackers will prevent his longer runs. Holds ball low in the pocket, vulnerable to strip-sacks. Will trust his arm and his receivers too much, throwing passes into traffic downfield.",Backup
2013,Landry Jones,"The NFL-sized pocket passer can be decisive and flashes the accuracy to pick apart defenses at the next level. However, his tendency to get rattled under pressure is a major issue. Also, when things start to go downhill, he lacks a short memory; his confidence is shaken. He is also inconsistent in his reads and decision making.","Prototypical pocket passer with NFL size. Extremely productive. Can stretch the field with his arm and shows good zip on passes to all parts of the field when his feet are set. Quick release makes him very effective in the short to intermediate passing game. Challenging throws in every start, whether threading the ball versus cover-two or connecting on a back-shoulder pattern.","Really struggles when under duress. Feels pressure when it isn't there. Not an elite athlete, takes time to get to hand-off spot from under center. Can move out of the pocket to escape pressure, but is usually caught up in traffic and is brought down too easily in the backfield. Confidence waxes and wanes throughout the game and season. Ball comes out of his hand poorly at times, floating across or down the field. Downfield accuracy is erratic, missing open receivers on the run; also misfires on out routes too often. Inconsistent on his touch on fades or throws over the top of defenders. Looks to the sidelines for pre-snap adjustments, looks to be confused by complex defensive looks.",Backup
2013,Brad Sorenson,"An older prospects who served a Mormon mission after high school, Sorensen played one year of junior college before walking on at BYU, then transferring to SUU when it looked like his playing time in Provo would be limited. The 2011 Great West Offensive Player of the Year has the NFL size and arm to earn himself a late-round grade as a he fights for a spot on a team.","Looks like an NFL pocket passer, usually leading the wide-open passing offense from a shotgun look. Uses his above-average arm strength to throw darts to the typical hitch and out routes to move the team along, though he flashes an ability to change his arm angles and unload a bullet if pressure is coming. Patient waiting for the deep dig to open up, and can fit the ball into tight windows on the sideline as well as over the middle. Throttles down that cannon arm, showing some touch on fades or when trying to throw over the top of a defender to lead his man downfield. Bullish runner, even acting as a lead blocker near the goal line on occasion, and can move out of the pocket and deliver the ball when needed.","Not an exceptional athlete, won’t elude or run over NFL defenders. His decisions under pressure aren’t always what coaches like to see; trusts his arm too much, which leads to turnovers (his interceptions increased from six in 2010 to 11 in 2011). Hasn’t faced a lot of top-level competition in his career.",Backup
2013,Zac Dysert,"Dysert reminded scouts a bit of Roethlisberger by displaying toughness and more of a playmaker’s game than pure efficiency during his breakout 2011 season (3,513 passing yards, 65.8 percent completion rate, 23 touchdowns). He does not quite possess the two-time Super Bowl champ’s elite arm and bulk, but still has enough of both – along with the athleticism and deft passing touch to make NFL-caliber plays on the run – to become one of the top passers in the class. His career flew somewhat under the radar in the MAC conference, but has the size, arm, accuracy, athleticism, and production that NFL teams covet.","Looks like an NFL quarterback, and has more room to add muscle to his frame. Keeps a solid base, active feet, and has a reliable over-the-top delivery for his accurate passes to all levels of the field. Good athlete for his size, able to sidestep and run away from blitzers in the backfield while usually keeping his eyes downfield to see if a receiver breaks open. Picks up first downs, or simply gets something out of nothing, with his feet. Shows the strength, in terms of body and arm, to get passes off with defenders hanging off his body in the pocket. Will get out of bounds instead of taking a hit on the run. Has experience both under center and in shotgun, but played in more of a shotgun spread scheme during his senior year. Flashes anticipation on crossing routes to hit his man on the run. Throws accurately on the move to his left or right, and will stop to set his feet if there’s time on moving pockets. His arm is strong enough to fling the ball 40 yards downfield on the run, and also to throw in tight windows over the middle. Flashes great placement on fades and sideline throws, puts ball on his man’s shoulder where only he can catch it. Good strength to pull down the ball at the last minute as well as step through tackle attempts in the pocket. Communicates with receivers pre-snap if he sees something worth exploiting in the defense. Big body and quick feet are helpful on quarterback sneaks. Mechanically sound overall. Has held for placement kicks.","Pocket poise needs to improve; takes off from the pocket if his primary read is covered or he sees pressure, but is also inconsistent feeling backside rushers. Needs to prove he can find check-downs and secondary options from the pocket. Will stare down his target, allowing defenders to follow his eyes to the ball. Accuracy in the intermediate portion of the field can be streaky. Straight-line speed and elusiveness aren’t elite, quicker NFL defenders will track him down in the pocket and will make him pay for running too often. May have picked up bad habits playing for an undermanned team. Can be prone to over-improvisation and trusts his arm too much at times, throwing balls up for grabs or across his body into traffic over the middle.",Backup
2013,Sean Renfree,"Renfree is a tall, well-built quarterback. He's made too many poor decisions resulting in interceptions over his career, but he has the arm strength to make all the throws. When this is combined with his experience in an NFL-like offense, it's possible that a team will take a liking to him as a backup quarterback.","Tall, with a well built frame. Possesses decent athletic ability for his size. Strong arm, can make all the throws. Shows velocity on out patterns and deep routes. Solid footwork and a smooth release. Does a good job of throwing receivers open. Willing to take chances.","Has never put up great numbers. Will make poor decisions that lead to interceptions. There are times when he won't work through his progressions properly, and will simply lock on to his intended target. Injury history.",Backup
2012,Andrew Luck,"Sans the late-rise of Heisman trophy winning QB Robert Griffin III, Luck likely would have been considered one of the most sure-thing prospects in the past decade. He is a prototypical pro-style quarterback who can make all the line calls, formation shifts, pass drops, and throws necessary to be successful at the next level. He will likely be the top pick overall and start immediately, and he possesses the intangibles to be a franchise stalwart for years to come.","Luck's intangibles are what set him apart from any other talented quarterback. As an athlete, he has all the traits of a franchise quarterback. He is tough, durable and willing to step into a throw with oncoming rushers breathing down his back. He has a deliberate set-up with no wasted motions and has really developed and showcased the ability to play from many different looks while at Stanford. He developed under the tutelage of both Jim Harbaugh and David Shaw, two coaches who know how to develop quarterbacks. Luck has the size to take a hit, and the athletic ability to get outside and make plays happen with his feet. Once on the move, he makes his second and third reads with ease. He has a very compact and quick release, and he is able to fire it out to the flats with ease off one-step drops in the short passing game. The most intriguing aspect of Luck's career was the amount of mistakes he made, a number which only continued to decrease throughout his career. He rarely forces a ball into tight coverage. He won't make any mistakes off the field, and rarely makes them on it. He is a strong, natural, competitive, athletic quarterback.","One would be hard-pressed to find negatives to Luck's game. There are no glaring weaknesses in his play, and while some could argue he isn't the athlete that RG3 is, that is simply not his game. He displays the athleticism necessary to excel as a pocket passer. There are times when Luck second-guessed passes and simply didn't see a breaking corner coming from another zone, such as the play that almost got Stanford beat towards the end of a high-energy USC game, but for the most part Luck works to identify and improve on his weaknesses.",Franchise QB
2012,Robert Griffin III,"Many would argue that RG3 is not only the most physically gifted quarterback in the 2012 draft, but that he is the most talented player overall. His intangibles are making so many general managers swoon. Griffin, because of his athletic ability and Joe Montana-like ability to extend plays and remain focused on moving the ball downfield, not to mention his hurdling ability, stands to potentially be the better prospect when matching up physical traits with Luck. Nonetheless, RG3 likely will be a top-five pick and is so talented that teams with large investments in young quarterbacks, such as Sam Bradford in St. Louis, will have a tough time passing up on the opportunity to draft a potential game-changer.","RG3 is a talented quarterback who was built for the position. Although he is slightly undersized, his athletic ability lends well to him being able to be an NFL-type quarterback who can make plays with his feet, extend plays, make the deep throw, and lead a team down the field. He has some of the same natural talents that Cam Newton had in the 2011 draft, sans the size. Griffin overcomes a slight size deficiency by simply being so athletic that defenders rarely get a shot on him. As a hurdler (out of high school) it is apparent that RG3 is extremely explosive. He drops back with absolute ease. He is able to feel comfortable enough in the pocket to step into a throw in traffic, or reset outside the pocket. At this point, unlike Luck, he can also move the ball downfield with his feet. While many would argue that RG3 might be an athlete playing quarterback, his senior year reaffirmed that he is simply an athletic quarterback, a guy who can make all the smart throws first, and create later if necessary.","RG3 has a slight size deficiency and could have some durability issues if he is hit enough times. He anticipates plays so well and is able to react to a point where he should be able to avoid big hits, even at the pro-level. His junior year was a test to see how well he could recover from a torn ACL in his sophomore year, and he came back just as strong. Some might worry that he will look to run first at the next level, but this could easily be curbed through coaching and a good support system on the offense. He truly had one strong season in college, but playing in a talented Big 12 conference and winning the Heisman likely puts a rest to those concerns, as well.",High End Starter
2012,Ryan Tannehill,"Tannehill is a dynamic athlete at quarterback, so much so that he was a major contributor at receiver for his first two-plus years with the Aggies before becoming their starting signal-caller. In his early starts at quarterback, this NFL-sized prospect was more of a gunslinger, but he has now morphed into an effective and efficient passer in the pocket. Tannehill is a also fierce competitor with the overall tools to be a first- or second-round selection and eventual starter in the NFL.","When dropping, Tannehill is calm and makes it obvious that he is a natural athlete at the position. He has a good feel for pressure and has turned his scrambling ability around to where it is a heavy asset in the passing game, as he has developed a great feel for extending the play. He is mechanically sound and can anticipate where the receiver will be, and displays fairly consistent accuracy throughout all routes. He is a consummate running threat.","Tannehill has only displayed for one year that he has the arm and decision making at quarterback to start in the NFL. He did a lot to dispel concerns in his senior year, but he will need to continue to develop and likely won't be a starting option as a rookie.",High End Starter
2012,Brandon Weeden,"Weeden joined the Cowboys after a stint playing professional baseball in the minor leagues, and Oklahoma State fans have been pleased that he elected to play college football. Weeden has been the signal caller for one of the country's most efficient offenses. He is a poised, effective thrower who has great pocket presence and makes quick decisions with the ball that keep the chains moving. He rarely throws interceptions despite the high number of attempts in his scheme, and he could go as high as the second round.","Weeden has an NFL-quality frame that allows him to look over the offensive line and deliver his throws without a hitch. His quick release is his strongest asset, as he consistently gets the ball out with a compact throwing motion and strong delivery. The ball zips off his arm and he has the ability to fit it in any tight space with great velocity. He is ""all of the above"" in terms of being a mature, poised leader. He is an accurate passer both short and long, and he has that gunslinger mentality to go for the deep ball and give his receivers a chance. He understands route progressions and throwing the ball to where his guy can make a play.","Despite his baseball background, Weeden is only an average athlete and is very limited when scrambling. He has a tough time getting outside the pocket, and his accuracy and touch decrease immensely when he scrambles. He seems to grasp route concepts and looks for his second option, but he will hold the ball for extended periods of times and could be a product of his quick-read offensive scheme.",Backup
2012,Brock Osweiler,"Osweiler is an intriguing early-entry prospect out of Arizona State. He started for Dennis Erickson's Sun Devils for just two years before opting to leave a year of eligibility on the table with the mass exodus of both the ASU coaching staff and a solid group of senior starters. A good athlete for the position, Osweiler was originally signed on to play basketball at Gonzaga before opting to play football at ASU. He has the arm strength to be a first-day pick but hasn't shown the consistency that is characteristic of guys who deserve first-round money.","Osweiler has a very deliberate, quick-twitched setup which he employs on a consistent basis. His athletic ability allows him to play the position naturally and with ease. He slings the ball naturally, as well, and even though he pats the ball before throwing, his release is so compact and effective he isn't hindered by this habit in the slightest. His shining asset is his arm strength; he can hit nearly any NFL-caliber throw at this point in his career. He is a good leader and looks in control in the huddle and on the field. He is above average from an accuracy standpoint, and he really has a good grasp on when to add touch to the ball or to zip it. He has the pocket presence of a first-day pick and doesn't go down easily. He is good to extend plays with his feet.","Osweiler had on-the-field judgment issues throughout his career at ASU and isn't reliable to protect the ball from turnovers. It seems as if he starts to get rolling in a game, and the more confidence he builds, the more of a gun-slinger mentality he adopts. This severely hinders his play. When under control, early in the game, he is athletic, accurate, and a good game manager. He will need to learn to hone in some of the competitive traits that have helped lead him to success up to this point. He is likely a developmental prospect who could struggle if forced to play early on.",Low End Starter
2012,Russell Wilson,"Wilson is this year's big-time question mark at quarterback. Unlike those who have held this title in the past, Wilson is a stellar passer who shows arm strength and accuracy when he is able to deliver the ball without a hitch. A transfer from North Carolina St. over the summer, he has outstanding football intelligence as he picked up the Wisconsin offense in a short time and was the opening-day starter. However, at his height teams will have concerns whether or not he can see to make the throws at the next level. He is a mechanical mover who has strong technique and leadership qualities. If Wilson were three inches taller there would be debate at the top of the draft as to where he fits in, but look for teams to take a flier on him in late rounds to see if he can develop and outplay his size.","Wilson is an accurate passer. He is a very mechanical quarterback who is consistent in his drop step and thoroughly understands how to move within the pocket and evade when the pocket collapses. He is an athlete and can torque his body to make any sort of throw on the run, and is accurate in this setting. He is a born signal caller who shows command of the offense. He has the arm strength to make the deep throws and the touch to put it on a receiver in stride. He is effective when scrambling and is a classic play extender.",Wilson's height will be his biggest inhibitor at the next level and the largest reason for his late-round value. It remains to be seen if he can throw effectively from the pocket at the next level.,Franchise QB
2012,Nick Foles,"Foles has been a productive signal caller for Arizona over three years as a starter and has the arm strength and size that garners first-day consideration for teams looking to fill a void at quarterback. He is a mechanically sound passer who has a solid release. In a different year, it's possible that Foles could be vying for the top quarterback spot; he is hit with hard luck by being in the middle of a quarterback-laden class. He is a big-time leader who rarely gets rattled. Foles' athletic ability will be a concern to some, and while he is projected as more of a ""game manager"" type, his skill set comes together nicely so he should be at least a serviceable starter at the next level. If teams can fall in love with his arm strength, he could be selected as early as the second round to develop and become an eventual starter.","Foles has a strong arm that gets him through various other hitches in his game. There are times when Foles throws the deep, cross-field out-route while on his back foot (and facing pressure) accurately and with ease. While not the most athletic quarterback, he is aware in the pocket to avoid pressure and has a good sense of how and when to extend a play to his advantage. As a deep passer he has strength but can struggle with accuracy at times. His accuracy is evident in his short to intermediate throws, where he can put it right on a receiver or lead him fluidly in stride. He would be more valuable in a West Coast scheme where could make quick decisions and not be forced to unleash deep throws on a consistent basis. He is an excellent game manager for moving the ball in bunches up the field. He is extremely poised in the pocket and rarely lets a heavy pass rush rattle his throws.","Mobility has been the Achilles heel for Foles and will likely continue to be exposed even more at the next level. He is solely a pocket passer and hardly ever moves the chains with his feet. He has the ability to extend, but he is not going to out-run any defenders at the next level. This can sometimes effect his set-up, as it can be uncoordinated at times, although rarely affects his actual pass. There are times when the ball can get away from him when throwing deep, and he has struggled with accuracy there. His release is sufficient but not fast by any means. His judgment with the ball is somewhat questioned, as he can be slow to get rid of the ball and scramble into trouble.",Low End Starter
2012,Kirk Cousins,"Cousins was a three-year starter, as well as a rare three-year captain, at Michigan State. He is a self-made guy, a tireless worker who has deficiencies that could hurt his pro potential. He is not a very strong deep thrower; while his velocity is adequate, his accuracy when throwing deep is questionable. Ultimately, Cousins is a guy who could get drafted based on his experience and intangibles, and will need to put on size and fine-tune certain throwing deficiencies to catch on at the next level. Based on the production and leadership at Michigan State, Cousins has late-round value to a team looking for someone to compete for a backup role.","Cousins has all the intangibles necessary for an NFL quarterback and has been a productive three-year starter. The fact that he was a three-year captain will be highly regarded by NFL general managers. He is an accurate and safe thrower who knows how to pick his spots. He is a good athlete who can make plays on the run, but is not going to run past many NFL defenders. A safe pick as a backup option.","Cousins is widely considered to be a game manager type at the next level. He makes good decisions with the ball but has not shown he can make the flash plays to move the offense and win games for his team at the next level. He will need talent around him to succeed, which limits his value.",High End Starter
2012,Ryan Lindley,"Lindley is an athletic signal caller from San Diego State who has first-round talent when assessing simply his arm strength. The strongest senior thrower in this year's draft, Lindley can make cross-field deep out throws with ease. He is athletic in his pass set and does a good job surveying the field for his second and third reads. His problems have surrounded his judgment at times in games, where can rely too heavily on his ""gun slinger"" mentality and get into trouble with interceptions and poorly placed balls. On his size and arm strength alone, Lindley should be selected in the late third round to a team looking to use him as a developmental project behind a currently stable quarterback situation.","Lindley has a very lively arm and can drive the ball from anywhere on the field off his back foot. When he is having a good game, Lindley can thread the needle and put the ball on a receiver in stride 65 yards down the field. He is athletic in his pass set and is good to extend plays and fend off would-be rushers. Lindley is a developmental talent who has value to teams who are willing to be patient with him. He could develop into a starter based off his size and arm strength.","Lindley has been inaccurate at times and will take some time to develop at the next level. He will throw an NFL pass one play, and then come back to make a bad decision and put his team in trouble. He is athletic but can be a slow mover and take sacks from holding on to the ball too long. Most of his issues stem from his inconsistency throwing the ball in intermediate and deep routes.",Backup
2012,BJ Coleman,"Coleman started for three years at Tennessee-Chattanooga (though he missed four games in 2011 due to a sprained right shoulder) after transferring from Tennessee, where he lost the starting job during spring practices his sophomore year. He is a good-sized, accurate passer who has shown starting qualities at the next level. He has fourth-round value based on his skill set and production.",Coleman has a quick set-up and plays with a good sense of urgency. He is athletic when scrambling and can place it on receivers both in the short and long passing situations. He is a leader and makes good decisions. Coleman can really drive the ball into his receivers and shows NFL-level zip on his throws.,Coleman has struggled with his route progression and being able to locate second receivers. He is aware in the pocket but can get rattled by pressure at times and will hold onto the ball and take sacks rather than distribute to viable outlets.,Backup
2012,Chandler Harnish,"Harnish could be compared in many ways to this years NFL sensation, Tim Tebow. While not quite the bruising runner that Tebow is, Harnish has a similar frame and style of play. He relies more heavily on his speed than power when running, but has been a true dual-threat at the position, posting gaudy total offense numbers each year. He has the type of running style that could be effective at the next level, but don't look for him to switch to H-back anytime soon. Has just enough arm talent to make it happen with his feet when the play breaks down. He has yet to prove himself as an accurate passer, and this could hurt his stock, but look for teams to select Harnish in the late rounds as a developmental project or change-of-pace quarterback/running threat.",Harnish is a powerful and effective scrambler and a better thrower on the run than he is in the pocket. He is a gamer; understands how to run an offense and when to pick his spots to take off running. Harnish is a fast and explosive athlete who uses good judgment as a passer. Has had the type of productivity that is noticeable despite playing in a small conference.,"Harnish has the arm strength, frame, and mentality to be a starting quarterback at the next level, but his accuracy is so off at times that it brings his value all the way down to late rounds. He will struggle early on adjusting to the speed and timing of NFL offenses.",Backup
2011,Cam Newton,"Newton is one of the most athletically gifted quarterbacks in draft history. Possesses a quick, clean release, enough arm strength to complete the deep out, prototypical size, and is a dangerous threat outside of the pocket. However, he has a ways to go before turning into a productive, reliable NFL starter. Was not asked to make pro-style reads or move through progressions in college. Footwork is sloppy and accuracy is inconsistent. He's competitive and vocal on the field, but has had several off-the-field issues and his character is in question. Despite the risk, Newton's talent will likely prevent him from lasting past the middle of the first round.","Newton has a rare blend of height, strength and speed. Fierce competitor and emotional leader. Flashes the ability to zip the ball into tight spots. Has a quick, over-the-top delivery. Puts a ton of revolutions on the ball and can make all the throws. Frequently evades the rush for second-chance opportunities. Threat to pick up large chunks when he tucks.","Not proficient at going through his progressions or making NFL reads. Doesn't anticipate receivers getting open, must see them in a window. Inconsistent accuracy due to poor footwork and falling away to avoid a big hit. Despite athleticism, needs to improve his drop mechanics and the finer points of pocket mobility. Numerous off the field issues worth investigating.",Franchise QB
2011,Jake Locker,"Locker decided to return for his senior season and his erratic performance has certainly hurt his draft stock. An extremely gifted athlete, Locker's production does not match his talent. He possesses a cannon for an arm, but he is not an efficient passer. At this point, his greatest asset is his athleticism and it is unclear if he will ever be a starting quarterback at the next level. Also, Locker has a history of injuries due to his aggressive style of play. Overall, Locker has all the physical tools and a team will likely take a chance on him in the first round despite his inconsistent production.",Locker is tall enough with a sturdy muscular build and excellent athleticism for the position. Has a rocket arm to make all the throws and fits the ball into tight windows. Shows the ability to scan the field and check down with very good touch. Extremely mobile and can make plays with his feet. Fierce competitor and leader.,Does not show the ability to consistently make his progressions and find the open man. Misses on too many throws and his accuracy can be erratic at times. Abandons the pass early and relies too much on his feet.

2011,Blaine Gabbert,"Gabbert has it all physically, but has a long way to go before he's ready to lead an NFL offense. He played in a spread offense and will have to learn to take snaps under center and make progressions in the pocket. However, he is a smart football player that seems to understand coverages and he has the arm strength to fit the ball into tight windows. He is also very mobile and elusive in the pocket and shows the ability to make plays with his feet. Overall, Gabbert's tools will be too alluring for a team without a quarterback, and he will likely be a top-10 pick, maybe even the first QB off the board.",Gabbert has prototypical size and excellent speed for the position.

Exhibits the physical and mental toughness you like to see. Has enough arm strength but doesn't put elite zip on the ball and will try to fit it into too many tight spots downfield. Ponder has slowly climbed up boards, and he is almost certain to go in the second round.",Ponder's very tight and sound in his drop. Accelerates quickly when escaping the pocket. Will make plays in the open field after tucking. Can buy time with his feet and keep his eyes downfield. Does a good job in the short passing game getting the ball out quickly with accuracy. Exhibits great leadership qualities and toughness.,Must improve his overall decision making and awareness. Will lock onto his first option and struggle to move through his progressions.

2011,Andy Dalton,"Dalton is four-year starter and proven winner, but he will have a difficult transition to the NFL. He is undersized and will not be able to take off and run at the next level. He is generally an accurate passer, however he will make some poor throws when his mechanics break down. Also, he plays in a very user friendly scheme where he throws to a lot of wide open receivers and it is unclear if he can fit the ball into tight windows. Dalton will need some time to learn a more complicated offense and he looks to be a mid-round pick.","Dalton is a well prepared player that scans the whole field and makes solid decisions.

Arm strength is good but needs to tighten up his delivery and work on getting the ball out on time with more consistency. Can make a lot of plays with his feet but will be too confident at times and take unnecessary sacks. Kaepernick will likely attract a team with his measurables and outstanding intangibles. His stock has risen considerably with solid workouts, so expect him to be taken some time in the second to third round.","Kaepernick is an excellent blend of height, build and speed for a quarterback.

Displays smooth mechanics. Fluid, over-the-top delivery. Will fit the ball into tight spots and shows good overall accuracy. Has experience in the pro-style passing game. Good pocket mobility, can buy second chances and keeps his head down field. Fierce competitor and can command the huddle.",Flashes the ability to run through progressions but has lapses in judgment and can force throws when pressured. Accuracy is solid but needs to become more consistent. Ball will sail when footwork gets sloppy. Does not have the athleticism to pick up much yardage with his feet at the next level. Potential maturity/character issues.,Backup
2011,Ricky Stanzi,"Stanzi possesses the mental makeup and on-field moxy of a starting NFL quarterback but still has quite a bit of development left before he's ready. Can be a playmaker when using his feet to buy extra time, scrambling to throw, and allowing receivers more time to break free. Is accurate on shorter passes but must improve consistency on intermediate and deep routes. Flashes the ability to go through his progressions but ultimately still locks onto primary targets and forces too many throws. If Stanzi can improve his accuracy, awareness and footwork, could be a good one.","Stanzi displays great leadership qualities, toughness and intangibles. Can escape the pocket, improvise and make plays. Has the mobility necessary to evade the outside rush, climb the pocket, and buy more time. Has enough athleticism to pick up first downs with his legs. Displays good accuracy in the short passing game. Has enough arm strength.",Decision-making must improve. Takes too many chances and puts the ball in harms way too often. Unsound footwork leads to inaccuracy on intermediate and deep throws. Needs to do a better job of leading receivers. Doesn't have a quick release and can hold the ball a tick too long.,Backup
2011,TJ Yates,"Yates likely does not possess enough physical tools (arm, feet) to be considered a future starter but has a ton of experience in a pro-style offense and could find a home as a backup. At times, appears to be a confident decision-maker in the pocket, capable of efficiently managing his team but occasionally forces throws and is not comfortable dealing with pressure. Shows good accuracy and touch in the short passing game but is not as effective when asked to drive the ball downfield. Tough player who has dealt with adversity and become a better player. Day 3 prospect.","Yates has ideal height, a good build and adequate mobility. Displays a clean, over-the-top delivery and throws a catchable ball. Knows when to take something off.

2011,Nathan Enderle,"Enderle has the work ethic, game experience and desire to understand the finer points of playing quarterback that it takes to stick as a backup in the league. Assumed some NFL-like duties in college such as changing plays at the line. Can make some plays getting the ball out of his hand on three-step drops or climbing vertically in the pocket to allow receivers more time to get open. Throwing accuracy and arm strength are only adequate but could improve with more sound release mechanics and quickness. Enderle's a Day 3, developmental quarterback prospect.",Enderle has a lot of starts under his belt. Has a good work-ethic and is a student of the position. Appears to have the mental makeup needed to play on Sundays. Shouldered pre-snap adjustment responsibilities. Shows solid accuracy on some intermediate to deep throws.

Throws interceptions when trying to fit the ball into tight windows downfield. Will take too many sacks attempting to scan the field. Can be confused by complex zone coverage schemes.,Backup
2011,Tyrod Taylor,"Taylor is a hard working kid that has improved every year, but it is unclear if he can play quarterback at the next level. He has a quick release and a strong arm, but he is somewhat erratic as a passer. He also does not show the consistent sound decision making to be an efficient quarterback. His greatest asset is his athleticism and he should be able to contribute immediately as a running back, receiver or return man. A terrific senior season, where he completed nearly 60% of his passes, has helped his draft stock and he could sneak into the third round.",Taylor is an excellent athlete with a thick muscular build. Has excellent mobility and continually evades the rush while keeping his eyes downfield. Has above average arm strength and flashes the ability to fit the ball into tight windows on short to intermediate routes. Team leader and fierce competitor.,Does not possess adequate height and too many of his passes are knocked down at the line. Sloppy footwork prevents him from stepping into throws making him an erratic passer. Locks onto receivers and often telegraphs his throws.

2011,Greg McElroy,"McElroy could quickly emerge as a quality backup NFL quarterback but does not possess the physical attributes of a starter. Fully grasps the mental side of the game and has succeeded in multiple pressure-packed situations but simply does not have the arm strength to force and NFL defense to defend the entire field. Comfortable making NFL-type reads, accurate when hitting short to intermediate targets, and capable of moving around in the pocket. However, we don't expect him to be able to hit the deep out or zip the ball into tight coverage at the next level, so McElroy carries a late Day 3 grade.",McElroy has rare intangibles. Team-first player who works tirelessly at practice and in the film room to master an offense. Can scan the field and run through his progressions. Will throw receivers open.

Below average speed and not a threat to pick up yards with his legs.,Backup
2010,Sam Bradford,"The statistics are there and he has operated in a pro-style offense as a freshman. He does throw pro routes, however, he WILL get nitpicked. Matt Leinart was nitpicked. Aaron Rodgers was nitpicked. Brady Quinn was nitpicked. Bradford won’t have any challenges this season, so scouts and draftniks will find the flaws. Bradford is a top-20 pick, but don’t be shocked if he doesn’t go as high as we expect (Top 5) next April.","Good size with room to add some bulk. Peyton Manning-like accuracy. Outstanding job of anticipating routes. Solid arm strength. Capable of making all the throws. Smooth, consistent spiral. Textbook footwork and can drop back if asked.

2010,Tim Tebow,Tebow is arguably one of the best college quarterbacks of all time. He has won a lot of games over the years as he is a perfect fit for Urban Meyer’s offensive system. He will need a lot of retraining when he gets to an NFL camp as he plays out of the shotgun formation and will need a lot of work on dropping from center and setting up in the pocket while reading coverage schemes. He has a strong arm but his accuracy has been inconsistent over the years as he often ends up throwing the ball when on the move. He is not generally real quick to pull the trigger once he decides where he wants to throw the ball.,Tebow has the size and bulk to hold up at the next level. Is a highly-competitive player. Exhibits rare character on and off the field. Is athletic enough to pick up tough yards with his legs. Was extremely productive in college. Possesses very good arm strength. Is a winning football player.,"Tebow really struggles with his accuracy. Release is far to slow to fit balls into spots against NFL defensive backs. Release point and mechanics (elongated, wind-mill delivery which comes out too low) likely need to be altered. Was not asked to run through pro-style progressions and struggled reading defenses, especially those with NFL concepts, in college.",Backup
2010,Jimmy Clausen,"Clausen has been the face of the Notre Dame program for the past three years and has shown improvement in virtually every aspect of his game each year. He lacks a cannon for an arm but he does have a live arm and a quick delivery that allows him to get the ball out quickly. He has close to a ¾-arm delivery which coupled with his lack of top height can cause some of his passes to get knocked down or tipped by pass rushers. He has been well coached and understands a pro style offense, so he is apt to come to camp better prepared than most. He is recovering from toe surgery and will not participate in combine drills.",Clausen’s a highly-competitive signal-caller who was has been very productive in a pro-style system during his career. Possesses a live arm and flashes the ability to make all the NFL throws. Displays impressive accuracy in the short passing game. Is athletic and mobile for the position and can avoid the rush and make plays outside the pocket. Has a very quick delivery.,Clausen has a somewhat low release point. Release point combined with less-than-ideal height leaves Clausen susceptible to having passes batted down at the line. Has a strong arm but lacks premier arm strength and may struggle at times fitting the ball into windows deep down the field. He will be unable to participate in combine drills due to toe surgery.,Backup
2010,Colt McCoy,McCoy is a once in a lifetime college quarterback. He has done everything right while at Texas and has done a great job of representing the university on and off the field. Unfortunately his skills don’t translate to his being a lock to make it big at the next level.

He understands the game and does a good job of reading coverages and making good decisions before and after the snap. He is athletic and has done a wonderful job of hitting the weights to improve his physical stature.,McCoy is a natural leader with high character. Played with a lot of intelligence in Texas’ system which he mastered. Was extremely productive. Possesses a quick release.

Release point is a little low. Needs to improve his accuracy on long passes down the field and toward the sideline.,Backup
2010,Mike Kafka,"Kafka rebounded for a nice senior season after being bounced around and showing a lot of inconsistencies during his first three years. He is a touch passer that relies on timing and accuracy with the short throws to get the job done. He has marginal arm strength and needs room to step into his throws in order to get any zip on the ball. He generally takes the snap from the shotgun formation and will need his share of time to learn how to go under center, take the snap and drop to the pocket. He is a smart quarterback that can read coverages and go through his progressions but has too many physical limitations to be considered more than a backup.",Kafka possesses nice size to scan the field. Is an accurate passer who exhibits nice touch on underneath routes. Shows a good sense of timing. Can work through multiple progressions and understands route combination concepts.

2010,John Skelton,"Skelton is a good-sized quarterback with a major league arm. The problem is that he does not know how to use his arm to his advantage. He tends to rely on arm strength alone, when throwing the ball and does not do a good job of getting his feet set under him when throwing from the pocket. He can throw on the move, but his accuracy suffers a lot. He will need a ton of work when it comes to reading NFL coverages and going through his progressions as he looks for the best target. Teams may get too enamored with his arm strength and overlook how much development it will take before he is ready to play.",Skelton possesses prototypical height and bulk.

2010,Tony Pike,Pike is a bit of a product of the system that has been in place with the Cincinnati Bearcats. He gets a lot of completions due to their dink and dunk passing attack that spreads the field out and relies primarily on their passing game to move the ball. He knows how to read coverages but will get stuck on his primary receiver at times rather than go to his second or third option. He is effective throwing from the pocket or when rolling to his right but will struggle when rolling left and having to throw back against the grain. He has struggled to stay healthy for a full season in college and will need to bulk up if he wants to survive the rigors of a full NFL season.,"Pike has good character and has battled back from injuries.

He has adequate arm strength but compensates with a live arm that allows him to get the ball out quickly and does not give defenders a lot of time to get a jump on his throws. He needs work on going through his progressions and looking defenders off and will force too many passes causing more interceptions than he should throw. He is athletic and can extend the pocket or throw the ball on the move but will likely never be more than a second or third quarterback on an NFL team.","Robinson is a high-character player. Exhibits impressive mental toughness in terms of preparation off the field and grit on the field. Displays a live arm at times to make difficult throws. Is very accurate in the short passing game.

2009,Matthew Stafford,"Blessed with a stronger and more accurate arm than many current NFL quarterbacks, Stafford possesses the type of upside that has in the past guaranteed a high first-round selection. Considered by many to be the top prep quarterback in the country when he signed with Georgia, Stafford led Highland Park High School to their first state title since 1957 and in the process earned the EA National Player of the Year. Despite less than impressive statistics (1,749 passing yards, 7-13 TD-to-INT ratio), Stafford earned All-SEC Freshman accolades in going 6-2 as a true freshman starter, earning victories against the likes of then-No. 5 Auburn, No. 14 Georgia Tech and rallying Georgia from a 21-3 deficit in the Chick-Fil-A Bowl to earn MVP honors in the victory over No. 16-ranked Virginia Tech. Significant statistical improvement as a sophomore (2,523 yards, 19-10 TD-INT) and another bowl game victory (over Hawaii in the Sugar Bowl), along with the emergence of superstar running back Knowshon Moreno, led to huge expectations for 2008. Stafford and the Bulldogs were unable to fulfill the expectations of their preseason No. 1 ranking, but his record-breaking junior campaign (3,459 yards, 25 TD-10 INT) and third bowl victory (Michigan State, Capital One Bowl) underlined his talent. Scouts have concerns about Stafford trusting his arm with risky throws, but considering his marked improvement in a pro-style offense, durability and production again SEC competition, Stafford ranks among the elite talent in the 2009 draft. Had an arm span of 33 1/4 inches and a hand span of 10 inches at the combine.","Perhaps a bit shorter than preferred, but has excellent bulk and strength for the position. ...

2009,Mark Sanchez,"Sanchez surprised many, including coach Pete Carroll, with his decision to leave after serving as the starting quarterback of the Trojans for just one season. It's hard to find fault with his production. He was first-team All-Pac-10 in completing 65.8 percnt of his passes for 3,207 yards, 34 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions and led USC to a surprisingly easy victory over Penn State in the Rose Bowl. His effort against Penn State (28 of 35 passing for 413 passing yards, four TDs) and a weak senior class of quarterbacks created the momentum to catapult Sanchez into first-round conversation. Teams considering Sanchez that early do so at their own risk. He has less than the equivalent of a full NFL season as a starter. Regardless of how impressive he was at times for USC, this small sample size might not be enough to convince NFL teams he's worth millions as a pillar of their franchise.

2009,Josh Freeman,"The highly recruited high school quarterback had an up-and-down career at Kansas State, but felt he showed enough to put his hat into the NFL Draft a year early. Strong-armed and mobile, Freeman led the Wildcats to their last bowl game as a true freshman. As a sophomore and junior, he completed 61.2 percent of his passes with 38 touchdowns and 19 interceptions. He also ran for 404 yards and 14 scores as a junior. His father, Ron, played in the USFL and was his high school defensive coordinator. It will be a process developing Freeman, but some team may take a chance in the first two rounds based on potential. Had an arm span of 32 3/4 inches and a hand span of 10 inches at the combine.","Tall frame with a solid build. Arm strength allows him to make all of the NFL throws and attack the deep half. Stands tall, and will step up in the pocket, keep his eyes downfield and deliver the ball to secondary target. Good, not great, quickness on release. Keeps the ball low over the middle, away from defenders. Can be accurate on fades and corner routes, although he needs a bit more air under the ball. Good straight-ahead runner with long strides and deceptive speed, can shed arm tackles and uses his tall frame to get extra yards after contact. Dropped some weight for his senior year to improve his footwork and speed. Works under center and in the shotgun.","Must improve his footwork. Height makes him take long strides in his drop. Fails to step into his throws or square his shoulders at times, relying on his arm strength too often. Inconsistent accuracy from the pocket and throwing on the run. Needs to anticipate downfield throws better, sometimes getting the ball to his receiver a second early or late. Makes poor decisions trying to make plays that aren't there, leading to turnovers. Doesn't feel back-side pressure. Lacks touch on shorter throws. Ball comes out of his hands poorly at times, negating his arm strength. Sometimes pats the ball before the throws. Loose with the ball in the pocket and as a runner. Doesn't move the pile as you'd expect in short-yardage situations, but his height allows him to be effective.",Low End Starter
2009,Pat White,"With apologies to 1980's West Virginia QB Major Harris, many consider White to be the best player ever to suit up in Morgantown. He was the first quarterback in the history of college football to start, set an all-time rushing record for quarterbacks and won everything from All-American honors to Big East Offensive Player of the Year (twice) and three bowl game MVPs. Teams will have to decide where he fits in the NFL before making him a top 75 selection, however. Does he have the size and skills to play quarterback? Some scouts think he has earned the right to try with his 2008 performance (1,842 yards passing, 65.7 completion percentage, 21 touchdowns vs. seven interceptions). Or does he have the hands to switch to receiver? There is no question about his speed, toughness or leadership abilities, however. He'll get a shot somewhere, somehow. Had an arm span of 33 1/2 inches and a hand span of 9 1/4 inches at the combine.","Excellent speed and vision with the ball in his hands. Makes defenders miss with spin and juke moves in the open. Will also take and deliver big hits despite his wiry frame. Has a solid arm despite a lack of upper body strength. Adequate accuracy on skinny posts and longer throws down the middle of the field. Will look off the safety before throwing to his primary target. Team leader. Left-handed. Keeps his eyes downfield while scrambling, gets the ball to a teammate after defenders suck up due to his running threat.","May not have a pro position. Lacks prototypical quarterback size and is not strong enough to take a lot of hits. Relies on big passing lanes and play-action to give him the chance to find receivers downfield. Needs to prove he has the hands to play in the slot as a receiver. Does not always secure the ball, and will keep it in his strong hand even running right. Exclusively worked in the shotgun and spread offense, so he needs to work on taking snaps and ball fakes. Can get the ball deep but is not accurate on well-defended passes beyond 10-12 yards. Struggles with accuracy on the move. Throws off his back foot too often. Does not have great touch on short throws. Delivery is stiff and mechanical. Lacks patience in the pocket, and will take off too soon and misses open targets. Makes questionable decisions with the ball, trying to make a play when nothing's there. Ball comes out of his hand poorly at times.",Backup
2009,Rhett Bomar,"Signed by Oklahoma out of high school, Bomar played well as a redshirt freshman, winning the Holiday Bowl MVP in the Sooners' win over Oregon. However, he was dismissed from the team after accepting larger-than-earned paychecks from a Norman car dealership. His draft stock is still on the rise because his athleticism and arm strength are coveted by scouts in this weak senior quarterback class. The second-team All-Southland pick (3,355 yards, 27 touchdown passes) showed Kansas this September that his skills are still FBS-caliber as he threw for 340 yards despite his team being completely overmatched. Had an arm span of 32 inches and a hand span of 9 inches at the combine.","Adequate height and size, with strong bicep development. His quick release and arm strength allow him to throw accurately over the middle, across the field or on the run (to his left and right) from under center or the shotgun. Displayed above-average mobility, even early in the season when wearing a brace to protect a torn left ACL suffered late in 2007 (missed last two games). Can move within the pocket to find a passing lane and keep defenses honest by running for first downs (and more).","Strong leader, but straddles the line between confident and cocky. Lacks the size that can propel FCS quarterbacks like Joe Flacco into the first round. Locks onto receivers and gets stuck in the pocket (leading to sacks) if his primary read is not available.

2008,Matt Ryan,"When a new coaching staff, headed by Jeff Jagodzinski, took over at Boston College during the spring, there were many questions, but the staff felt that the quarterback picture was in very capable hands with Ryan at the helm. Recovered from a nagging foot injury that plagued him throughout the 2006 season, the lanky quarterback has compiled a 25-7 record as a starter for the Eagles. Ryan went on to earn Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year honors as a senior and was emerging as one of the Heisman Trophy favorites until the Eagles lost three of their final five regular season games. He would go on to rank eighth in the nation in total offense and established new school records for 400-yard passing performances in both a career and season, en route to throwing for 4,507 yards. At William Penn Charter School, Ryan earned All-East honors from Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report.

In that situation, he threw nine of his 10 interceptions in 2006 and 10 of 14 in '07...It is rare to see him force the ball, showing patience going through progressions and also has the intelligence to get innovative...Has the strength to stand tall in the pocket and will not be forced into rushing his throws (will take a sack rather than fire into traffic)...Not easy to knock down once he gets on the move and is a slippery runner who lacks valid foot speed, but has good side-step agility...Inspires the confidence of the entire team on the field and he is a mature leader who won't point fingers, rather accepting blame for a broken play...Excels throwing in the short area, as he puts good zip and touch on his throws, especially on underneath and crossing routes...Can vary his speed and take something off when working in this area...Very good game manager who has the pinpoint accuracy to put the ball into tight areas and keeps the receivers in their routes, doing a nice job of hitting them out of the breaks...Can vary the speed on his short throws, but can drill it to his targets while on the move without having his man have to adjust...Has a nice feel for pocket pressure, demonstrating the vision to locate the backside action and does a good job of stepping up and out to avoid, but will not hesitate to tuck the ball and run with it, if he locates a good crease...Has the ideal height you look for in a quarterback to scan the field over the defensive linemen and is quick to check down and locate his secondary receivers, keeping defenses honest when rolling out, as he does not need to set his feet to fire the ball on the move...In 2007, he showed improved footwork in his setup, driving back from center much smoother than in the past...Surveys the field and goes through progressions well, but needs to look off his primary target more often...Worked hard to improve throwing the deep pass with better placement...Not really an escape artist, but he shows good awareness to pressure and has enough mobility to elude heat in the pocket...Knows how to vary the speed of his tosses when working underneath.","Lacks the arm strength to challenge the deep secondary, as his long throws tend to flutter or hang up long enough for defenders to attack the ball in flight (see 2006 Brigham Young and Wake Forest contests and 2007 Massachusetts and Virginia Tech games)...Needs to do a better job of planting his feet to get more zip behind his long throws...Has inconsistent and adequate velocity when firing the ball deep...Weakest area of his game is exposed when he attempts to fire the deep ball, as the pass tends to lack accuracy...Runs too hot and cold when trying to air the ball out, as his long throws lack trajectory...Needs to improve timing on his deep throws, as he is very inconsistent hitting those targets coming out of cuts...Holds for PATs and field goals, but needs to be quicker fielding and placing the ball...Strong runner with the ball, but runs a bit erect, resulting in fumble issues, as he does not always protect the ball when breaking past the line of scrimmage...Does not have the foot quickness to keep defenses honest as a runner and while he shows good vision as a passer, he will run into a crowd when carrying the pigskin (needs to be more alert to cutback lanes)...When he generates a high push in his delivery or throws off his back foot, his passes lose some zip, resulting in a high amount of tosses getting deflected (see 2007 North Carolina State, Massachusetts, Virginia Tech and Florida State games)...When he holds on to the ball too long waiting for his receivers to break, he will leave his passes behind too often (see 2007 Wake Forest, Virginia Tech SEC Game, Florida State and Maryland contests)...Needs to make quicker decisions when he is flushed out of the pocket and must stop trying to force his throws into tight areas...Needs to protect the ball better; had fumble issues in 2007, especially after getting sacked (see 2007 Georgia Tech, Miami and Michigan State games). Compares To: MATT SCHAUB-Houston...Before 2007, Ryan looked a lot like the Jets' Chad Pennington, only much more effective utilizing a short-to-intermediate area passing attack. He has good mobility to throw when flushed out of the pocket and is an efficient game manager. He shows good strength stepping up in the pocket and the lateral agility to side-step the bull rush, but is not a threat to get big real estate with his feet. He lacks accuracy and arm strength when unleashing the long ball, as most of his interceptions were the result of him trying to attack the deep secondary. He is a cool field general with a great work ethic and shows some similarity to Rich Gannon (ex-Raiders, Chiefs) in his ability to be innovative on the field. He is not a good fit for a vertical passing attack, but for a team comfortable moving the chains with a mistake-free engineer at the helm, they could find a nice fit in Ryan during the draft's first day.",Franchise QB
2008,Joe Flacco,"Flacco is one of the more intriguing quarterback prospects of this draft. While he lacks the big name of some of the other highly ranked prospects, he possesses the prototypical combination of size and arm strength scouts are looking for. His steady improvement while at Delaware bodes well for his future development in the NFL, but Flacco's ability to handle the greater speed of the NFL is the determining factor of his final draft status. Scouts are anxious to see how Flacco responds in senior all-star games.","Certainly looks the part. ... Tall, rangy frame with room to add additional mass. ... Prototype arm strength. ...

Isn't a finished product, but shows the tools worthy of development. ... Hasn't missed a game due to injury in his collegiate career.","Wasn't able to beat out Tyler Palko at Pittsburgh and only became a starter after transferring to lower level Delaware. ... Protected at Delaware with a strong running game. ... Improved feel in the pocket, but still hangs on to the ball too long and isn't particularly mobile. ... Took the majority of the snaps at Delaware in the shotgun, raising questions about his ability to make the transition to the typical QB-center exchange, especially considering his lack of foot quickness. ... Can slide up into the pocket to buy time, but isn't going to scare defenses with his scrambling ability. ... Tends to lock-on to his receivers.",Low End Starter
2001,Drew Brees,"The unquestioned leader of the Boilermakers' offense and one of the school's most decorated athletes...The three-year starter shattered virtually every school passing record and also made his marks on the Big Ten Conference and NCAA Division 1-A record charts...Ranks fourth in NCAA annals with 1525 pass attempts, 942 completions and 11,815 yards in total offense (NCAA does not recognize bowl stats)...Including post-season action, he holds the Boilermaker and conference career-records with 1026 pass completions of 1678 passes for 11,792 yards, 90 touchdown tosses and 12,692 yards in total offense...His pass completion percentage of .611 set another Purdue all-time record...

Elusive scrambler with the body control to avoid the rush.,"Plays in the spread offense, taking the bulk of his snaps from the shotgun... Tends to side-arm his passes going deep...Lacks accuracy and touch on his long throws... Seems more comfortable in the short/intermediate passing attack...Does not possess the ideal height you look for in a pro passer, though his ability to scan the field helps him compensate in this area...Will improvise and run when the passing lanes are clogged, but tends to run through defenders rather than trying to avoid them to prevent unnecessary punishment.",Franchise QB
2004,Aaron Rodgers,A late bloomer who enrolled into junior college (Butte) before joining the University of California. Took over as the starter from the fifth game and completed 61.6 percent of passes. Had problems with ball security in early games but emerged as a strong quarterback. The most complete quarterback in the 2005 class. Shows great leadership skills and coaches speak highly of his work ethic.,He possesses outstanding arm strength. Ability to make necessary throws in the NFL. Has the ability to fit the ball in tight spots and has great fundamentals and mechanics. He can lay the ball between linebackers and safeties in coverage with the ability to throw accurate deep passes. A poised player in the pockets with a great vision of the field.,Not the ideal size for a quarterback. Does not possess the threat to take off and run on a consistent basis. His stats might be good only as a result of the quarterback friendly playing system of coach Tedford. Durability is a concern due to knee surgery in 2004. Needs work to adjust to elaborate defensive schemes in the NFL.,Franchise QB
2001,Michael Vick,"Considered by many to be the most exciting player in college football... Gutsy performer who plays with injuries that would sideline most...Despite playing only two seasons with the Hokies, he is only the second quarterback in school history to rush for over 1000 yards in a career (1202)... Ranks seventh on Virginia Tech's all-time passing list with 3074 yards and sixth with 4276 yards in total offense...Including post-season action, the he compiled a 20-2 record in the games he's played in at Tech (20-1 as a starter).","Versatile scrambler who is very tough to defend...Shows quick feet and excellent balance, smoothly dropping back from center in his set-up...Has a snappy overhead delivery and a good feel for reading defenses...Knows how to lay the ball away from defenders on his deep tosses and shows good touch on his post patterns...

Has a little bit of a wind-up in his release when throwing long, which makes his receivers work a little harder in order to get to the ball...Has good arm strength, but needs to refine his throwing mechanics, as he is not that quick to load and reload in his delivery.",High End Starter
